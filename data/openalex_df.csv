manufacturing,Biomedical applications of hydrogels: A review of patents and commercial products,"Hydrogels have become very popular due to their unique properties such as high water content, softness, flexibility and biocompatibility. Natural and synthetic hydrophilic polymers can be physically or chemically cross-linked in order to produce hydrogels. Their resemblance to living tissue opens up many opportunities for applications in biomedical areas. Currently, hydrogels are used for manufacturing contact lenses, hygiene products, tissue engineering scaffolds, drug delivery systems and wound dressings. This review provides an analysis of their main characteristics and biomedical applications.

manufacturing,Manufacturing of Soft Contact Lenses Using Reusable and Reliable Cyclic Olefin Copolymer Moulds,"We present experimental evidence of reusable, reliable cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) moulds in soft contact lens manufacturing. The moulds showed high performance surface roughness characteristics despite >20 kW exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light from repeated use. Ultra-precision manufacturing techniques were used to fabricate transparent COC mould inserts and to produce soft contact lenses from liquid monomer compositions. Both polymer and silicone hydrogels were fabricated with more than 60 individual uses of the moulds. White light interferometry measured the surface roughness (Sa) of the COC moulds to be almost unchanged before and after repeated use (Sa 16.3 nm before vs. 16.6 nm after). The surface roughness of the prototyped lenses and that of commercially available soft contact lenses were then compared by white light interferometry. The surface roughness of the lenses was also nearly unchanged, despite undergoing more than 60 uses of the COC moulds (lens Sa 24.4 nm before vs. after Sa 26.5 nm). By comparison the roughness of the commercial lenses ranged from 9.3−28.5 nm, including conventional and silicone lenses, indicating that the reusable COC moulds produced competitive surface properties. In summary, COC moulds have potential as reusable and reliable mould inserts in the manufacturing of soft contact lenses, yet maintain high quality optical surfaces even after sustained exposure to UV light.",2022-11-02,Christopher S.

manufacturing,Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels Reinforced with Nanocellulose for Ophthalmic Applications: General Characteristics and Optical Properties,"Globally, uncorrected refractive errors are one of the main causes of visual impairment, and contact lenses form an important part of modern day eye care and culture. Several hydrogels with varying physicochemical properties are in use to manufacture soft contact lenses. Hydrogels are generally too soft and reinforcement with appropriate materials is desirable to achieve high water content without compromising mechanical properties.

manufacturing,Impact of Manufacturing Technology and Material Composition on the Clinical Performance of Hydrogel Lenses,"Purpose. To establish the clinical impact of three different methods of manufacture used to produce soft contact lenses. Methods. Clinical performance of five lens types was investigated by undertaking a prospective, double-masked, randomized, crossover study. Three of the lenses were made from poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) by three different manufacturing processes (lathing, spin casting, and cast molding), and the remaining two lenses were cast molded from different materials—hydroxyethyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid and hydroxyethyl methacrylate/glycerol methacrylate (HEMA/GMA). All lenses were specially fabricated for this work at the same manufacturing plant. Thirty-four soft contact lens wearers wore each lens for 1 month on a daily-wear basis. Several clinical variables, such as ocular response, visual acuity, lens fitting, prelens tear film, lens surface dehydration, subjective response, and protein deposition, were measured. Results. In general, the spun-cast pHEMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other pHEMA lenses. This lens induced significantly more limbal and conjunctival hyperemia than the cast-molded lens and provided poorer low contrast visual acuity (LCVA) than the other two lenses. It dehydrated more and had the least on-eye movement. However, the spun-cast lens deposited the least protein of the pHEMA lenses. In general, the HEMA/GMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other cast-molded lenses. LCVA was worse with this lens, and subjective responses showed that this lens was thought to give the worst visual performance of the cast-molded lenses. It was also thought to be the most difficult lens to handle. Significantly more breakages occurred with this lens than any other. Conclusions. Overall, this work has shown that manufacturing method and material composition have a fundamental effect on many clinical properties of a lens. Therefore, method of manufacture is also an important consideration in the overall production of a soft lens.",2004-06-01,Carole Maldonado‐Codina,Nathan Efron,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it investigates different manufacturing methods and material compositions of hydrogel lenses, highlighting the clinical performance impacts of these technologies.

manufacturing,Therapeutic Contact Lenses with Polymeric Vehicles for Ocular Drug Delivery: A Review,"The eye has many barriers with specific anatomies that make it difficult to deliver drugs to targeted ocular tissues, and topical administration using eye drops or ointments usually needs multiple instillations to maintain the drugs’ therapeutic concentration because of their low bioavailability. A drug-eluting contact lens is one of the more promising platforms for controllable ocular drug delivery, and, among various manufacturing methods for drug-eluting contact lenses, incorporation of novel polymeric vehicles with versatile features makes it possible to deliver the drugs in a sustained and extended manner. Using the diverse physicochemical properties of polymers for nanoparticles or implants that are selected according to the characteristics of drugs, enhancement of encapsulation efficiency and prolonged drug release are possible. Even though therapeutic contact lenses with polymeric vehicles allow us to achieve sustained ocular drug delivery, drug leaching during storage and distribution and the possibility of problems related to surface roughness due to the incorporated vehicles still need to be discussed before application in a real clinic. This review highlights the overall trends in methodology to develop therapeutic contact lenses with polymeric vehicles and discusses the limitations including comparison to cosmetically tinted soft contact lenses.",2018-07-01,Seung Woo Choi,Jaeyun Kim,Sungkyunkwan University,KR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,A Wirelessly Powered Smart Contact Lens with Reconfigurable Wide Range and Tunable Sensitivity Sensor Readout Circuitry,"This study presented a wireless smart contact lens system that was composed of a reconfigurable capacitive sensor interface circuitry and wirelessly powered radio-frequency identification (RFID) addressable system for sensor control and data communication. In order to improve compliance and reduce user discomfort, a capacitive sensor was embedded on a soft contact lens of 200 μm thickness using commercially available bio-compatible lens material and a standard manufacturing process. The results indicated that the reconfigurable sensor interface achieved sensitivity and baseline tuning up to 120 pF while consuming only 110 μW power. The range and sensitivity tuning of the readout circuitry ensured a reliable operation with respect to sensor fabrication variations and independent calibration of the sensor baseline for individuals. The on-chip voltage scaling allowed the further extension of the detection range and prevented the implementation of large on-chip elements. The on-lens system enabled the detection of capacitive variation caused by pressure changes in the range of 2.25 to 30 mmHg and hydration level variation from a distance of 1 cm using incident power from an RFID reader at 26.5 dBm.",2017-01-07,Jin‐Chern Chiou,Shun-Hsi Hsu,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,TW,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses a smart contact lens that incorporates advanced sensor technology using commercially available bio-compatible materials and a standard manufacturing process.

manufacturing,Surface chemical structure for soft contact lenses as a function of polymer processing,"The surface chemistry and topography of cast-molded Etafilcon-A and doubled-sided lathed Etafilcon-A soft contact lenses were determined to be significantly different. The variations in surface chemical and morphologic structure between the two lenses were the result of contact lens manufacturing methods. The surface of the cast-molded Etafilcon-A had a consistently less rough surface compared to the doubled sided lathed Etafilcon-A as determined by atomic force microscopy. The surface of the doubled sided lathed Etafilcon-A contained primarily silicone and wax contamination in addition to minute amounts of HEMA. The cast-molded Etafilcon-A had an elemental and chemical content which was consistent with the polymer stoichiometry. Contact angle wettability profiles revealed inherent wettability differences between the two lenses types. The cast-molded Etafilcon-A had an inherently greater water wettability, polarity, and critical surface tension. This means that these two lenses cannot be compared as similar or identical lens materials in terms of surface composition. The manufacturing method used to produce a soft contact lens directly determines the surface elemental and chemical structure as well as the morphology of the finished lens material. These results suggest possible differences in the clinical comfort, spoilage, and lubricity felt during patient wear. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",1996-09-01,George L. Grobe,Paul L. Valint,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses the impact of different manufacturing methods on the surface chemistry and morphology of soft contact lenses, specifically contrasting cast-molded and lathed Etafilcon-A lenses.

manufacturing,Impact of manufacturing technology and material composition on the mechanical properties of hydrogel contact lenses,"Abstract Hydrogel materials are not only different as a result of different co‐monomer compositions but also as a result of the manufacturing method used to produce them. Hydrogel contact lenses fabricated by different methods are subjected to markedly different processing steps, which are likely to affect the resultant material network structure of a lens. The mechanical performance of five soft contact lens types was investigated using one conventional technique (tensile test) and three novel techniques (probe, tear and ball milling tests). The five lens groups consisted of three polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA) lenses which were each manufactured by a different technique: lathing, spin‐casting and cast‐moulding, a HEMA/methacrylic acid (HEMA/MAA) cast‐moulded lens and a HEMA/glycerol methacrylate (HEMA/GMA) cast‐moulded lens. Overall, the results show that the best mechanical performance is obtained for the pHEMA lenses, with some differences occurring between the lenses. The HEMA/GMA lens showed the worst performance.",2004-10-19,Carole Maldonado‐Codina,Nathan Efron,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it investigates the mechanical properties of hydrogel contact lenses produced by various manufacturing methods, including non-injection moulded techniques.

manufacturing,A Comparison of Wavefront Aberrations in Eyes Wearing Different Types of Soft Contact Lenses,"Purpose. The purpose of this study is to investigate the optical quality of eyes wearing different types of soft contact lenses (sCLs) using wavefront aberrometry. Method. A psychophysical aberrometer (WFA1000B; BriteEye, SuZhou, China) was used to measure wavefront aberrations for 56 eyes of 28 subjects under four conditions: 1) without contact lenses (non-CL), 2) with lathe-cut contact lenses (lathe-cut CL; Shuliang, Weicon Optics, Shanghai, China), 3) with cast-molded contact lenses (cast-molded CL; Vistavue, J&J Vision Care, U.S.), and 4) with spun-cast contact lenses (spun-cast CL; Lanfenzhiji, Justcome Optics, Beijing, China). The three types of sCLs were made from different materials and lens design. The root mean square (RMS) values of the wavefront aberrations and individual Zernike aberrations were calculated and compared among the CL-wearing conditions. Results. Astigmatism was not significantly changed by any of the three soft contact lenses when compared with the non-CL condition. However, a significant difference in the RMS values of higher-order aberrations was observed between the lens types (F = 8.29, p < 0.0001). Induced higher-order aberrations were found for both the cast-molded CL and the spun-cast CL conditions. There were significant differences in the aberrations in each of the higher orders between the CL conditions (F = 3.77, p = 0.011 for third order; F = 5.31, p = 0.002 for fourth order; F = 13.86, p < 0.0001 for fifth and higher orders). More higher-order Zernike aberrations such as coma and spherical aberration were induced by cast-molded CLs and/or the spun-cast CLs. Conclusion. Wavefront aberrations in the eyes with soft contact lenses vary from one individual lens type to another. Although the variation in wavefront aberrations could be attributed to the differences in the methods of manufacture, influences from other factors such as the lens material and lens design could not be excluded and deserve further investigation.",2006-10-01,Jiang Hong-jun,Dan Wang,Peking University,CN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it compares the optical quality and wavefront aberrations of different types of soft contact lenses, specifically highlighting the effects of manufacturing methods on optical performance.

manufacturing,Quantification of Intramolecular Cyclization in Branched Copolymers by<sup>1</sup>H NMR Spectroscopy,"Statistical copolymerization of a monovinyl with a divinyl monomer leads to macroscopic gels, microgels, or soluble branched copolymers, depending on the precise reaction conditions. This approach is widely used for the manufacture of soft contact lenses and also to prepare various biomedical hydrogels for the separation and purification of proteins, DNA, etc. According to Flory–Stockmayer theory, gelation should occur in such copolymerizations if there is more than 0.50 fully reacted divinyl comonomer per primary chain. However, many experimental studies indicate significant deviations from this classical theory, which are generally believed to be due to wastage of the divinyl comonomer via intramolecular cyclization. Unfortunately, experimental verification of this side reaction has proven elusive for the past seven decades. In the present study, we use a disulfide-based cleavable bifunctional comonomer to undertake the first experimental quantification of the extent of intramolecular cyclization in nonlinear methacrylic copolymers using 1H NMR spectroscopy.",2012-03-13,Julien Rosselgong,Steven P.

manufacturing,PDMS and its Suitability for Analytical Microfluidic Devices,"Poly(dimethylsiloxane) also known as PDMS is used in a wide range of biomedical applications. These range from implants through catheters to soft contact lenses. Therefore, it is understandable that PDMS has been extensively tested for these purposes. In past years, the microfluidics has moved from predominantly silicon and glass structures towards polymers due to their ease of manufacturing and moderate cost. PDMS has gained a lot of attention in various analytical applications. However, the testing of its suitability for such applications has not been as thorough as in the biomedical applications, perhaps relying on the experiments from that field. Microfluidic PDMS structures are more and more popular in various analytical devices. Such devices consume less reagents and can work with lower sample volumes. On the other hand, the surface-to-sample-volume ratio becomes larger. That increases the influence of material properties on the actual measurement. Some of the challenges include adsorption, diffusion, surface roughness, permeability and elasticity of PDMS, which are discussed in this paper.",2006-08-01,Johana Kuncová-Kallio,Pasi Kallio,Tampere University,FI,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Noncontact Tonometry through Soft Contact Lenses,"Under some circumstances it is advantageous to measure intraocular pressure (IOP) without removing soft contact lenses. In this study comparisons have been made between IOP measurements [using a noncontact tonometer (NCT)] with and without soft contact lenses on the eye. The influence of lenses of different water content, lens design, lens power, method of manufacture, and lens center thickness was examined. The most important parameter affecting the results was center thickness. It was shown that reliable and valid IOP findings can be obtained using a NCT with soft lenses on the eye when center thickness is less than 0.15 mm. In glaucoma screening readings obtained with lenses thicker than 0.15 mm may be convenient and useful although such results would be achieved with increased sensitivity and concomitant reduced specificity.",1986-12-01,Charles W.

manufacturing,Near‐Field Communication Powered Hydrogel‐Based Smart Contact Lens,"Abstract Nowadays, smart contact lenses (SCLs) display interesting features for healthcare monitoring; however, their comfort and practical usability strongly depend on the outermost material in contact with the eye. In this publication, the embedding of a custom‐made and thermoformed Near‐Field Communication based circuit in a conventional soft CL is presented. The circuit is composed of gold tracks on polyimide between thermoplastic polyurethane layers (insert), while the lens is based on industry standard double‐molding process of poly(2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with proven compatibility with corneal tissue. The lens shows stable geometrical parameters (bevel landing area) thus enabling a practical implementation. Finite element method models are used to optimize the thermoforming process in order to provide a stable and desired curvature of the insert before the embedding process. While the insert is designed to allow oxygen transmission at the center of the lens, a custom‐made ultra‐compact radio‐frequency antenna provides communication and wireless power transfer both in air and inside saline solutions. The successful combination of the intrinsic soft mechanical properties of the wirelessly powered electronic insert with conventional hydrogel materials and manufacturing processes delivers a practical solution for SCLs. This enables non‐invasive applications in fields such as vision correction and/or biomedical sensing.",2020-11-12,Andrés Vásquez Quintero,Ritsuko Arai,Ghent University,BE,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Optical Assessment of Soft Contact Lens Edge-Thickness,"ABSTRACT Purpose To assess the edge shape of soft contact lenses using Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GD-OCM) with a 2-μm imaging resolution in three dimensions and to generate edge-thickness profiles at different distances from the edge tip of soft contact lenses. Methods A high-speed custom-designed GD-OCM system was used to produce 3D images of the edge of an experimental soft contact lens (Bausch + Lomb, Rochester, NY) in four different configurations: in air, submerged into water, submerged into saline with contrast agent, and placed onto the cornea of a porcine eyeball. An algorithm to compute the edge-thickness was developed and applied to cross-sectional images. The proposed algorithm includes the accurate detection of the interfaces between the lens and the environment, and the correction of the refraction error. Results The sharply defined edge tip of a soft contact lens was visualized in 3D. Results showed precise thickness measurement of the contact lens edge profile. Fifty cross-sectional image frames for each configuration were used to test the robustness of the algorithm in evaluating the edge-thickness at any distance from the edge tip. The precision of the measurements was less than 0.2 μm. Conclusions The results confirmed the ability of GD-OCM to provide high-definition images of soft contact lens edges. As a nondestructive, precise, and fast metrology tool for soft contact lens measurement, the integration of GD-OCM in the design and manufacturing of contact lenses will be beneficial for further improvement in edge design and quality control. In the clinical perspective, the in vivo evaluation of the lens fitted onto the cornea will advance our understanding of how the edge interacts with the ocular surface. The latter will provide insights into the impact of long-term use of contact lenses on the visual performance.",2016-05-27,Patrice Tankam,Jungeun Won,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Poly(2-Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate) Hydrogels for Contact Lens Applications–A Review,"The emerging technology in biomedical engineering requires biocompatible materials, which are also referred to as biomaterials. For a material to be considered biocompatible, it should not interact with human tissues in a harmful way, and vice versa. Various properties of biocompatible materials, such as mechanical and optical properties, have to be considered for different biomedical applications. One of the most popular applications of biomaterials is for contact lenses. Hydrogels, specifically poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogels, are among the most popular ones in ophthalmologic applications, especially in soft contact lenses. This paper reviews the use of PHEMA hydrogels as one of the important biomaterials.

manufacturing,A metrological constant force stylus profiler,"A second-generation constant force profiler is described combining a capacitance based stylus force probe with interferometric optical metrology to monitor position of the specimen carriage. The probe has a vertical range of 15 μm with a resolution of 0.23 nm and a flat bandwidth response with a −3 dB cutoff at 228 Hz. Passing the output signal through a single pole 200 Hz low-pass filter, an overall system peak-to-peak broadband noise of less than 5 nm is observed. Manufactured primarily from inexpensive materials, the instrument demonstrates a stability of around 1 nm min−1 under controlled laboratory conditions. Using an inexpensive motor/gearbox/micrometer open-loop drive with velocity variations of up to 20%, profiles showing nanometer repeatability over 15 mm traces are demonstrated. Also shown is a profile of a soft contact lens in the hydrated state.

manufacturing,Controlled induction of spherical aberration with custom soft contact lenses,"This study investigated the non-invasive induction of spherical aberration (SA) levels consistent with complication-free wavefront-guided (WFG) refractive surgery using custom WFG soft contact lenses and quantified the resulting impact on visual performance.Twelve healthy individuals of typical military age (mean of 26.08 +/- 1.92 years) meeting the inclusion criteria of emmetropia (less than +/- 0.50 DS and less than +/- 0.50 DC) as measured by subjective refraction served as subjects. Five plano lenses were manufactured to induce a range of SA typical of those encountered after refractive surgery. The measured SA values over a 6 mm artificial pupil in these five lenses were -0.224 microm, 0.074 microm, 0.214 microm, 0.495 microm and 0.621 microm. For each subject, the level of total ocular aberrations through 10 Zernike radial orders over a 6 mm pupil was measured with a custom Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, while wearing each lens. Visual performance was evaluated using high contrast visual acuity (HCVA) measured through a 6 mm artificial pupil.Custom WFG soft contact lenses can be manufactured to include the range of SA that occurs with complication-free refractive surgery (-0.20 microm to +0.60 microm) and produces a change in SA within a similar range when worn on the eye. High contrast visual performance with these lenses varied, depending on the amount of SA in each lens. Visual performance worsened with greater amounts of positive or negative SA and a quadratic fit to the data peaked at +0.209 microm.Defined levels of SA can be manufactured and induced (non-invasively) with WFG soft contact lenses and their effect on logMAR high contrast visual performance can be measured. Results show that subjects' best logMAR HCVA occurs with the presence of positive residual SA. When designing the actual test lens, the targeted change in aberrations for each subject will likely be better achieved by first measuring the aberrations of a template lens on the eye and then compensating for unique subject dependent eye-lens interactions.",2009-04-01,Katrina E.

manufacturing,Development and Study of Applications Combining Nanopowder Imprint Lithography and Array-Type UV-Curing Technology for Micro-Lens Molding,"This study developed creative imprinting technology, combining nano-imprint lithography and array-type UV-curing technology. It used nanopowders as the method to transmit imprint force, and integrated technical features, such as soft lithography, light-curing resistant and gas-assisted imprint technology, in order to study the development of technological processes of micro-lens array manufacturing, and mature the application and technology of nano-imprinting. According to research results, SUS 304 stainless steel sheet with a micro-hole array could be smoothly fabricated into an original micro-lens array mold upon gas-assisted micro-hot embossing. At the same time, a micro-lens array structure with a complementary external form could be precisely remolded and reproduced by PDMS. Complete molding of micro-lens could be effectively achieved by combining imprints of gas-assisted lithography developed in this study, and even UV-NIL. The effective imprinting area and reproducibility of transfer printing could be greatly improved when a micro-lens contacts perfectly with a substrate surface. Moreover, since PDMS soft molds have short remolding times, and are easily feathered during manufacturing, production costs could be effectively reduced through features such as, low surface free energy, resistant to adhering to the mold during imprinting, and collocation of gas-assisted nanopowder imprinting of micro-structural processes.",2010-07-07,Yong-Cheng Wong,Yung-Jin Weng,National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,TW,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,A Biphasic Model for Micro-Indentation of a Hydrogel-Based Contact Lens,"The stiffness and hydraulic permeability of soft contact lenses may influence its clinical performance, e.g., on-eye movement, fitting, and wettability, and may be related to the occurrence of complications; e.g., lesions. It is therefore important to determine these properties in the design of comfortable contact lenses. Micro-indentation provides a nondestructive means of measuring mechanical properties of soft, hydrated contact lenses. However, certain geometrical and material considerations must be taken into account when analyzing output force-displacement (F-D) data. Rather than solely having a solid response, mechanical behavior of hydrogel contact lenses can be described as the coupled interaction between fluid transport through pores and solid matrix deformation. In addition, indentation of thin membranes ( approximately 100 microm) requires special consideration of boundary conditions at lens surfaces and at the indenter contact region. In this study, a biphasic finite element model was developed to simulate the micro-indentation of a hydrogel contact lens. The model accounts for a curved, thin hydrogel membrane supported on an impermeable mold. A time-varying boundary condition was implemented to model the contact interface between the impermeable spherical indenter and the lens. Parametric studies varying the indentation velocities and hydraulic permeability show F-D curves have a sensitive region outside of which the force response reaches asymptotic limits governed by either the solid matrix (slow indentation velocity, large permeability) or the fluid transport (high indentation velocity, low permeability). Using these results, biphasic properties (Young's modulus and hydraulic permeability) were estimated by fitting model results to F-D curves obtained at multiple indentation velocities (1.2 and 20 microm/s). Fitting to micro-indentation tests of Etafilcon A resulted in an estimated permeability range of 1.0 x 10(-15) to 5.0 x 10(-15) m(4)N s and Young's modulus range of 130 to 170 kPa.",2006-09-13,Xiaoming Chen,Alison C.

mold,Controlled release of prednisolone acetate from molecularly imprinted hydrogel contact lenses,"Abstract The aim of this work was to study the influence of methacrylic acid (MAA) as a comonomer and the application of a molecular imprinting technique on the loading and release properties of weakly crosslinked 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) hydrogels, with a view toward their use as reloadable soft contact lenses for the administration of prednisolone acetate (PA). The hydrogels were prepared with HEMA (95.90–98.30 mol %) as a backbone monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (140 m M ) as a crosslinker, and MAA (0, 50, 100, or 200 m M ) as a functional monomer. Different PA/MAA molar ratios (0, 1 : 8, 1 : 6, and 1 : 4) in the feed composition of the hydrogels were also applied to study the influence of the molecular imprinting technique on their binding properties. The hydrogels (0.4 mm thick) were synthesized by thermal polymerization at 60°C for 24 h in a polypropylene mold. The hydrogels were then characterized by the determination of their swelling and binding properties in water. Their loading and release properties were also studied in 0.9% NaCl and artificial lachrymal fluid. Increasing the MAA content of the hydrogel and applying the molecular imprinting technique led to an increase in the loading capacity of the hydrogel. The optimized imprinted hydrogel showed the highest affinity for PA and the greatest ability to control the release process, sustaining it for 48 h. The results obtained clearly indicate that the incorporation of MAA as a comonomer increased the PA loading capacity of hydrogel.

mold,A concept for bifocal contact‐ or intraocular lenses: liquid single crystal hydrogels (“LSCH”),"Abstract The synthesis of liquid single crystal hydrogels (“LSCH”) in suitable molds offers an innovative concept to realize bifocal contact‐ or intraocular‐lenses. LSCH combine the properties required for applications as bifocal ophthalmic lenses: the soft and water‐containing hydrogel enables oxygen permeation and exhibits high birefringence due to the liquid crystalline phase structure built up by rigid rod‐like amphiphiles. Via a photo‐initiated crosslinking reaction of aqueous solutions of monomeric lyotropic liquid crystalline amphiphiles in the macroscopically ordered liquid crystalline state, we obtain optically uniaxially ordered and transparent LSCH. The orientation process and the phase structure of the anisotropic hydrogel is analyzed by deuterium NMR‐spectroscopy.

mold,Ideal tetrafunctional amphiphilic PEG/PDMS conetworks by a dual‐purpose extender/crosslinker. II. Characterization and properties of water‐swollen membranes,"Abstract Select characteristics and properties of a series of ideal tetrafunctional amphiphilic conetworks consisting of random poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments crosslinked by a novel dual‐purpose crosslinker/extender were determined. The overall composition of the conetworks was varied in the 16–40% PEG range, and membranes were prepared by polymerizing/crosslinking charges in molds. Membranes were characterized by equilibrium swelling (both in water and n ‐heptane) and by determining their oxygen permeabilities and select mechanical properties. Swelling in water increases, whereas in heptane it decreases with increasing PEG content. Significant swelling in both solvents indicates bicontinuous (bipercolating) PEG and PDMS phases. Bicontinuity is reached with ∼13% PEG in the conetworks. The oxygen permeabilities of optically clear water‐swollen membranes containing 24, 32, and 40 wt % PEG are ∼350, ∼245 and ∼185 barrers, respectively, i.e. , oxygen permeability decreases by increasing the hydrophilic constituent. These oxygen permeabilities are far superior to those of contemporary soft contact lenses. The tensile strengths and moduli of water‐swollen membranes decrease, while elongations increase, with increasing PEG content. Dry membranes exhibit first order transitions at −52 and ∼46 °C indicating phase‐separated crystalline PDMS and PEG domains, respectively. Both dry and water‐swollen membranes are optically clear, indicating the presence of PEG and PDMS domains with dimensions well below the wavelength of visible light. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

mold,Moldable Crystalline α-Chitin Hydrogel with Toughness and Transparency toward Ocular Applications,"A N-acetylated chitosan hydrogel was investigated for ocular applications. One of the drawbacks in the original hydrogel protocol, poor moldability, was circumvented by optimizing the addition of the acetylating agent, acetic acid anhydride (Ac2O), at −10 °C. This simple but significant optimization realized the preparation of N-acetylated chitosan hydrogels with a wider variety of parameters such as higher chitosan concentration and molecular weight, the use of a more benign solvent (ethanol replaced methanol), and the arbitral shapes ranging from microbeads and contact lenses to bulky blocks that could be gripped. The prepared N-acetylated chitosan hydrogels exhibited high transparency and integrity given the nanofibrous network made of highly crystalline α-chitin. Furthermore, the gel retained a regenerable character: an oven-dried gel was reswollen by emersion in an acid bath. These previously unnoticed advantages and the innate high biocompatibility of chitosan and chitin elevate N-acetylated chitosan hydrogel as a next-generation bio-derived soft material for ocular applications such as contact lenses, artificial corneas, and drug delivery vehicles.",2020-03-17,Noriyuki Isobe,Mikiko Tsudome,Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,Metasurface‐Embedded Contact Lenses for Holographic Light Projection,"Contact lenses have been instrumental in vision correction and are expected to be utilized in augmented reality (AR) displays through the integration of electronic and optical components. In optics, metasurfaces, an array of sub-wavelength nanostructures, have offered optical multifunctionality in an ultra-compact form factor, facilitating integration into various imaging, and display systems. However, transferring metasurfaces onto contact lenses remains challenging due to the non-biocompatible materials of extant imprinting methods and the structural instability caused by the swelling and shrinking of the wetted surface. Here, a biocompatible method is presented to transfer metasurfaces onto contact lenses using hyaluronic acid (HA) as a soft mold and to allow for holographic light projection.

mold,The influence of PEGDA’s molecular weight on its mechanical properties in the context of biomedical applications,"Abstract Hydrogels are 3D polymeric networks, which exhibit properties such as softness, viscoelasticity and their ability to absorb large amounts of water. These characteristics make them exceptionally suitable in biomedicine as e.g. tissue scaffolds, drug delivery systems, wound dressings or contact lenses. One of these hydrogels is the biocompatible, hydrophilic and photopolymerizable poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). It is used in different biomedical applications due to its tunable mechanical characteristics. In our study, the mechanical properties of different PEGDA hydrogel compositions with variyng molecular masses and contents of water/methanol, were investigated. Different compositions containing 20 m%, 30 m% or 40 m% of PEGDA 4K (4,000 g/mol), PEGDA 10K (10,000 g/mol) or PEGDA 20K (20,000 g/mol) in ultrapure water/methanol (1:2) were produced. Dumbbell-shaped samples were prepared in molds via photopolymerization in a UV chamber. Lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) was used as photoinitiator (0.5% w/w). The mechanical testing was performed using a uniaxial testing system. The obtained results showed averagely 78% higher tensile strength (σmax) values for 30 m% and 40 m% samples in comparison with 20 m% samples for all of the tested polymers. PEGDA 20K 30 m% samples showed the highest σmax among all of the samples with 12.8 MPa. All of the PEGDA20K samples exhibited the highest elongation at break (εB) values (up to 958%), whereas the lowest values were found for PEGDA 4K (up to 105%). The obtained stress-strain curves for most of the samples were typical for deformable, amorphous polymers with a deformation upon reaching a critical stress point. The PEGDA materials showed variable mechanical characteristics according to changing molecular mass or polymer concentration. These promising results showed that it should be possible to compose scaffolds with desired mechanical stability according to the needed application.",2022-08-01,Natalia Rekowska,Daniela Arbeiter,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,The application of elastic auxiliary air bag imprinting technology to the development of linear gradient micro‐structure replication processes,"This study proposed an innovative imprinting process technology using an elastic auxiliary air bag imprinting mechanism, combined with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) soft mold and UV–LED array photocuring equipment, to evenly imprint and reproduce a micro‐lens mold into a gradient micro‐lens structure in order to achieve linear gradient in micro‐structures. The structure defined by the proposed process technology is more continuous and smoother than that of the current semi‐conductor gray scale photomasking process technology. The process is simpler, faster, and less expensive and is a more effective option for satisfying the formation requirements of different structural heights. This study used pressure‐sensitive film to test and discuss gradient imprint force distribution. The test results suggested that different spring constants led to tilt impressions, which caused the PDMS soft mold to contact with the substrate surface at different pressures. The color depth distribution of the pressure‐sensitive film testing results indicated that the spring constant and pressure distribution were somewhat correlated. Hence, the height of structural formation can be controlled by different spring constants. Finally, SEM and surface profiler measurements suggested that different spring constants can result in different tilt degrees of the imprinting platform of air bag imprinting applications for the imprinting and reproduction of smooth, continuous micro‐lens array structures of different heights.

mold,Design of polyurea networks containing anticancer and anti‐inflammatory drugs for dual drug delivery purposes,"Abstract Naproxen (Nap), a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug, and 5‐fluorouracil (5FU), an anticancer drug, were easily incorporated into a polyurea xerogel. Polyureas (PUr) were synthesized by one pot reaction via sol–gel chemistry. Soft segments were based on polyetheramine‐PEO and hard segments were based on a hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDI). The final materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Polyurea can assume many forms revealing its versatility in terms of produced shapes. In good agreement with FTIR, SAXS studies showed a microphase separated structure arising from inter‐hard‐domain spacings, which remains unchanged after incorporation of the drugs. DSC analysis demonstrated that the PEO chain mobility was poorly affected after the drugs incorporation due to the solvation of the drugs through the network. The water uptake and the amount of drug released agree well, playing an important role for controlled Nap and 5FU release.

injection,Applications of Hyaluronic Acid in Ophthalmology and Contact Lenses,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan that was first isolated and identified from the vitreous body of a bull’s eye. HA is ubiquitous in the soft connective tissues of animals and therefore has high tissue compatibility for use in medication.

Due to its broad range of applications, the identification and quantification of HA is a critical topic. This review article discusses current methods for analyzing HA. Contact lenses have become a widely used medical device, with HA commonly used as an additive to their production material, surface coating, and multipurpose solution.

In an animal model with rabbits, we used different devices for the application of MMC and measured extra- and intraocular concentrations by HPLC. In addition, the concentrations of MMC remaining in the devices were determined. The devices were (1) a regular surgical sponge, (2) a scleral shield, (3) a presoaked soft contact lens, (4) a soft contact lens with MMC application, and (5) subconjunctival injection. Ocular concentrations of MMC were similar within the first 4 groups and were highest in the last. The measurements suggest that MMC penetrates intraocularly regardless of the device used.

Current ophthalmic drug delivery systems are inadequate, particularly eye drops, which allow about 95% of the active substance to be lost through tear drainage. According to the literature, many interdisciplinary studies have been carried out on the ability of contact lenses to increase the penetration of topical therapeutic agents. Contact lenses limit drug loss by releasing the medicine into two layers of tears on either side of the contact lens, eventually extending the time of contact with the ocular surface. Thanks to weighted soft contact lenses, a continuous release of the drug over an extended period is possible. This article reviewed the various techniques to deliver medications through contact lenses, examining their advantages and disadvantages.

The uptake amount and the sustained-release kinetics of antibiotics were investigated in vitro, and were also compared with newly synthesized SCLs, etafilcon A and polymacon. The antibiotic concentrations in the cornea, aqueous humor, and crystalline lens, and the effect against bacterial proliferation were investigated in vivo using rabbit subjects.

drug,Advances in chemistry and composition of soft materials for drug releasing contact lenses,"Ocular drug delivery has always been a challenging feat to achieve in the field of medical sciences. One of the existing methods of non-invasive ocular drug delivery is the use of eye drops. However, drugs administered through these formulations have low bioavailability in the ocular system. This limitation can been overcome by using contact lenses as drug delivery vehicles. According to USA FDA definitions they can be categorized into two main categories-hard and soft contact lenses. Based on the material properties, hard contact lenses are mostly produced from polymers of acrylate monomers such as MMA (methyl methacrylate). These have the least water retention capacity, thereby, having minimal ability to diffuse oxygen into the corneal layer and are not ideal for long term use. Soft material contact lenses are flexible and are mainly hydrogel based. They have higher water retention capacities as compared to rigid contact lenses, which gives them the ability to transmit oxygen to the corneal layer. These hydrogel based soft materials are mainly produced from polymers of acrylate monomers such as HEMA (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and found to be better for drug delivery contact lenses. These polymer-based soft materials have been efficiently modified in terms of their chemistry to achieve diverse physicochemical properties to produce efficient ocular drug delivery systems. However, complications such as drug leaching during storage and distribution, sterilisation, preservation of integrity of the lens and the possibility of surface roughness due to the incorporated drug molecules still need to be optimised.

drug,Development of ocular drug delivery systems using molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses,"Recently, significant advances have been made in order to optimize drug delivery to ocular tissues. The main problems in ocular drug delivery are poor bioavailability and uncontrollable drug delivery of conventional ophthalmic preparations (e.g. eye drops). Hydrogels have been investigated since 1965 as new ocular drug delivery systems. Increase of hydrogel loading capacity, optimization of drug residence time on the ocular surface and biocompatibility with the eye tissue has been the main focus of previous studies. Molecular imprinting technology provided the opportunity to fulfill the above-mentioned objectives. Molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses (SCLs) have high potentials as novel drug delivery systems for the treatment of eye disorders. This technique is used for the preparation of polymers with specific binding sites for a template molecule. Previous studies indicated that molecular imprinting technology could be successfully applied for the preparation of SCLs as ocular drug delivery systems. Previous research, particularly in vivo studies, demonstrated that molecular imprinting is a versatile and effective method in optimizing the drug release behavior and enhancing the loading capacity of SCLs as new ocular drug delivery systems. This review highlights various potentials of molecularly imprinted contact lenses in enhancing the drug-loading capacity and controlling the drug release, compared to other ocular drug delivery systems.

Their loading and releasing properties were also studied in NaCl 0.9% and artificial lachrymal fluid. The results showed that using MAA as co-monomer and applying molecular imprinting technique increased loading capacity of hydrogels. The optimized imprinted hydrogel (MIP1:4), prepared with 400 mM MAA and DZD: MAA molar ratio of 1:4, had the highest affinity for DZD and the greatest ability to control the release process in aqueous media.

drug,In vitro release of two anti-muscarinic drugs from soft contact lenses,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the release of the anti-myopia drugs atropine sulfate and pirenzepine dihydrochloride from commercially available soft contact lenses. Standard ultraviolet (UV) absorbance-concentration curves were generated for atropine and pirenzepine. Ten commercially available contact lenses, including four multifocal lenses, were loaded by soaking in atropine or pirenzepine solutions at two different concentrations (10 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL). The release of the drugs into phosphate-buffered saline was determined over the course of 24 hours at 34°C using UV absorbance. Materials with surface charge released the greatest amount of atropine when loaded with either concentration when compared to the other lens types (p<0.05), releasing upward of 1.026±0.035 mg/lens and 0.979±0.024 mg/lens from etafilcon A and ocufilcon A, respectively. There were no significant differences in the amount of atropine or pirenzepine released from the multifocal and non-multifocal lenses made from the same lens materials. Narafilcon A material demonstrated prolonged release of up to 8 hours when loaded with pirenzepine, although the overall dose delivered from the lens into the solution was among the lowest of the materials investigated. The rest of the lenses reached a plateau within 2 hours of release, suggesting that they were unable to sustain drug release into the solution for long periods of time.

drug,Soft Contact Lens with Embedded Microtubes for Sustained and Self-Adaptive Drug Delivery for Glaucoma Treatment,"Because of the physiological and anatomical constraints of the eye, ophthalmic drug delivery is challenging. When applied topically, less than 1% of administered ophthalmic drugs reach the aqueous humor. The delivery of a drug within an efficient therapeutic concentration, to the required site of action, for an extended period of time, is complicated. Herein, a novel type of contact lens device, with embedded microtubes as drug containers, is reported. This device can provide a simple, noninvasive, extended drug release up to 45 days with higher bioavailability and lower risk for adverse effects.

drug,Drug release from liposome coated hydrogels for soft contact lenses: the blinking and temperature effect,"In this article, liposome-based coatings aiming to control drug release from therapeutic soft contact lenses (SCLs) materials are analyzed. A PHEMA based hydrogel material loaded with levofloxacin is used as model system for this research. The coatings are formed by polyelectrolyte layers containing liposomes of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and DMPC + cholesterol (DMPC + CHOL). The effect of friction and temperature on the drug release is investigated. The aim of the friction tests is to simulate the blinking of the eyelid in order to verify if the SCLs materials coated with liposomes are able to keep their properties, in particular the drug release ability. It was observed that under the study conditions, friction did not affect significantly the drug release from the liposome coated PHEMA material. In contrast, increasing the temperature of release leads to an increase of the drug diffusion rate through the hydrogel. This phenomenon is recorded both in the control and in the coated samples. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

drug,Adsorption of Actives in Ophthalmological Drugs for Over-The-Counter on Soft Contact Lens Surfaces,"The adsorption of various kinds of ionic/nonionic actives, added in ophthalmological drugs (artificial tear, contact lens wetting solution, eye-drops, and eyewash) for over-the-counter (marketable drugs with no need of any medical prescription) , on soft contact lens (SCL) surfaces has been studied as a function of hydrophobicity of the actives. The common logarithm of the 1-octanol/water partitioning coefficient (AC_log P) has been used in order to normalize the hydrophobicity of the actives employed in this study. No significant adsorption occurs for relatively hydrophilic actives, whereas the adsorption rate is gradually increased with an increase in the hydrophobicity of the actives. This suggests that the adsorption is predominantly governed by the hydrophobic interaction of the actives with the SCL surfaces, although an electrostatic interaction plays an additional role for the adsorption. The most effective adsorption occurs in the following active-lens combinations: cationic actives--the anionic and hydrated lens IV (methacrylic acid-based SCL); anionic actives---the nonionic and hydrated lens II (N-vinyl pyrrolidone-based SCL); and nonionic actives--the anionic and less-hydrated lens III (containing hydrophobic silicone monomers).",2009-01-01,Nobuhito Tabuchi,Tadashi Watanabe,Lion Corporation (Japan),JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

To increase efficiency and reduce side effects, the authors propose disposable particle-laden soft contact lenses for ophthalmic drug delivery. methods. The essential idea is to encapsulate the ophthalmic drug formulations in nanoparticles and to disperse these drug-laden particles in the lens material, such as poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (p-HEMA) hydrogels. The drug-laden p-HEMA hydrogels were synthesized by free radical solution polymerization of the monomers in presence of nanoparticles.

drug,Ocular Drug Delivery into the Eyes Using Drug-Releasing Soft Contact Lens,"The impact of visual impairment, such as blindness, on quality of life is immeasurable. However, effective ocular drug delivery into the eyes has not yet been established, primarily due to the impermeability imposed by the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) based on the tight junctions and efflux transporters at the endothelium or the epithelium in oral or intravenous administration, as well as the dilution with tear fluid and excretion through the nasolacrimal duct in eye drop administration. Furthermore, intravitreous injections induce pain and fear in patients. Unmet medical needs persist in ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, innovative non-invasive administration methods should be developed. Drug-releasing soft contact lenses (DR-SCLs) affixed to the eye’s surface can continuously and locally deliver their loaded drugs to the eyes. The use of DR-SCLs is expected to greatly enhance the bioavailability and patient adherence to the drug regimen. It is known that several solute carrier (SLC) transporters are expressed in various parts of the eyes, including the cornea, the ciliary body, and the bulbar conjunctiva. Carrier-mediated transport through SLC transporters may occur in addition to passive diffusion. Moreover, nanoparticles can be loaded into DR-SCLs, offering various intelligent approaches based on modifications to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis/transcytosis or to control the loaded drug release within this delivery system.

drug,New Approach to Drug Delivery in Ophthalmological Practice: Development of Composite Ophthalmological Solution for Drug Loading of Soft Contact Lenses,"Introduction . This article provides a tentative justification of use of soft contact lenses as a carrier of ophthalmological solutions to eye tissues. Aim . The aim of the research is to develop the composition of the ophthalmic transport system for the treatment of glaucoma. Also, the proposed manufacturing algorithms were proposed for drug loading ophthalmological solutions. Materials and methods . Preparation of sodium hyaluronate solution was carried out based on the methodology described in EP 7.0 [01/2011:1472] (Sodium hyaluronate). Results and discussion . The conducted investigation with the purpose to justify a concentration of sodium hyaluronate helped to determine its concentration that gives the viscosity level as close to the upper limit stated in Russian Pharmacopoeia as possible. Buffer solution was chosen with criteria to use as less components in ophthalmological solution as possible. Also, it was found out that the more components are added to the viscous solution, the more viscosity level is decreased. Thus, initial viscosity of solution containing sodium hyaluronate was 149.59 mm 2 /s, and after addition of active pharmaceutical substance it dropped down to 88.49 mm 2 /s and 81.36 mm 2 /s for model solution number 1 and 2, respectively. After addition of citric acid and disodium hydrophosphate, the viscosity of model solution was found to be 78.11 mm 2 /s and 75.28 mm 2 /s for model solution number 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion . As a result of the studies, two alternative model compositions of an ophthalmic solution for the saturation of soft contact lenses for the treatment of glaucoma were proposed. The choice of active pharmaceutical substances, and excipients has been justified. Technological procedure of preparation of model solution was described and explained, where the most attention was paid on dissolving of sodium hyaluronate in purified water.",2020-11-26,Denis K.

drug,A novel approach to achieve semi-sustained drug delivery to the eye through asymmetric loading of soft contact lenses,"Soft contact lenses are increasingly being explored as a vehicle for controlled delivery of ophthalmic drugs. However, traditional methods of drug-loading by soaking have limitations such as burst delivery and the release of drugs at the front side of the lens, leading to poor drug efficacy and systemic side effects. This study introduces a new methodology, termed asymmetric drug loading, whereby the ophthalmic drug 'Rebamipide' is attached to and released from the post-lens (=cornea-contacting) surface exclusively. The methodology involves using polymeric microparticles that carry a lipophilic crystalline ophthalmic drug at their surface. These drug-loaded microparticles first transfer the drug to the concave surface of the contact lens, and when worn, the drug is transferred again, now from the lens to the cornea. This is achieved through the diffusion of the drug from one hydrophobic microenvironment (the silicone moieties of the contact lens polymer network) to another hydrophobic microenvironment (the corneal epithelium) over a short pathway. The second drug transfer was observed and studied in experiments using an ex vivo porcine eye model. The results show that the drug amount that was absorbed by the cornea after applying the rebamipide-loaded contact lenses is approximately 3× (10.7 ± 3.1 μg) as much as the amount of rebamipide that gets transferred after the instillation of one eye drop (1% solution (p < 0.001). The new drug-loading method offers a practical and reproducible means of delivering ophthalmic drugs to the cornea through soft contact lenses. The drug payloads achieved are comparable to dosages used during eye drop therapy.",2023-06-01,Malake Sarmout,Yutang Xiao,Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College,CN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it presents a novel approach to drug delivery using soft contact lenses, specifically through asymmetric loading methods.

This allows you to determine the methods of saturation of contact lenses with medicinal agents and will open up new opportunities in the treatment of ophthalmological diseases. The purpose of this preliminary fragment of large-scale research was to study the surface structure of soft contact lenses made of various polymers. The following polymers were used in the work: Nelfilcon A, Hilafilcon B, Nezofilcon A, Etafilcon A, Lotrafilcon B. The following pharmaceutical substances were used: Brimonidine Tartrate, Betaxolol Hydrochloride, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride. The surface structure of soft contact lenses was studied using atomic force microscopy. Each material under study has a different surface character, which together with the differences in pore properties determines its individuality. Based on this, it should be assumed that the surface of soft contact lenses affects the possibility of their potential use as a means of delivering drug agent molecules to the eye tissues.

drug,Nanoparticle-Laden Contact Lens for Controlled Ocular Delivery of Prednisolone: Formulation Optimization Using Statistical Experimental Design,"Human eye is one of the most accessible organs in the body, nonetheless, its physiology and associated precorneal factors such as nasolacrimal drainage, blinking, tear film, tear turnover, and induced lacrimation has significantly decreased the residence time of any foreign substances including pharmaceutical dosage forms. Soft contact lenses are promising delivery devices that can sustain the drug release and prolong residence time by acting as a geometric barrier to drug diffusion to tear fluid. This study investigates experimental parameters such as composition of polymer mixtures, stabilizer and the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient on the preparation of a polymeric drug delivery system for the topical ocular administration of Prednisolone. To achieve this goal, prednisolone-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were prepared by single emulsion solvent evaporation method. Prednisolone was quantified using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Nanoparticle size was mostly affected by the amount of co-polymer (PLGA) used whereas drug load was mostly affected by amount of prednisolone (API) used. Longer homogenization time along with higher amount of API yielded the smallest size nanoparticles. The nanoparticles prepared had an average particle size of 347.1 ± 11.9 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.081. The nanoparticles were then incorporated in the contact lens mixture before preparing them. Clear and transparent contact lenses were successfully prepared. When the nanoparticle (NP)-loaded contact lenses were compared with control contact lenses (unloaded NP contact lenses), a decrease in hydration by 2% (31.2% ± 1.25% hydration for the 0.2 g loaded NP contact lenses) and light transmission by 8% (unloaded NP contact lenses 94.5% NP 0.2 g incorporated contact lenses 86.23%). The wettability of the contact lenses remained within the desired value (<90 °C) even upon incorporation of the NP. NP alone and NP-loaded contact lenses both displayed a slow in vitro drug release of drug over 24 h; where 42.3% and 10.8% prednisolone release were achieved, respectively. Contact lenses can be used as a medicated device to sustain ocular drug delivery and improve patient compliance; nonetheless, patients and healthcare professionals' acceptability and perceptions of the new formulations entail further investigations.",2016-04-20,Amr ElShaer,Shelan M.

drug,Application of polymer gels containing side‐chain phosphate groups to drug‐delivery contact lenses,"Abstract Hydrogels that contain phosphate groups in side chains were studied for their usefulness in drug‐delivery soft contact lenses (SCLs). Naphazoline, a model drug having a cationic group, was incorporated into an SCL because of its phosphate groups and was released over a period of about 14 h. For the SCL, the naphazoline content was equivalent to the phosphate group content. It is suggested that drug‐delivery SCLs can be designed to contain the needed amount of a drug through the choice of the ionic group for the ligand. Furthermore, the SCL having amide groups and phosphate groups had high transparency and an unchanged shape. It is suggested that amide groups and phosphate groups must be introduced into the polymer in equimolar amounts to give the necessary polymer–drug interaction. Therefore, hydrogels having a drug‐delivery system were synthesized by the inclusion of a phosphate group and an amide group. These hydrogels are also applicable to SCL materials. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Host macrocycles, the most recognizable supramolecular motif, facilitate complex formation with an array of guests by inclusion in their portal. Commonly, an appended macrocycle forms a complex with appended guests on another polymer chain. The formation of poly(pseudo)rotaxanes is also demonstrated, wherein macrocycles are threaded by a polymer chain to give rise to physical cross‐linking by secondary non‐covalent interactions or polymer jamming.

The material was a silicone-based hydrogel, which was modified by molecular imprinting with MXF and coated by the layer-by-layer (LbL) method using natural polyelectrolytes: alginate (ALG), poly-L-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronate (HA) hyaluronate), crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Imprinting was used to increase the amount of MXF loaded and to sustain its release, while the LbL coating acted as a diffusion barrier for DCF and improved the surface properties. The drugs were loaded by soaking in a DCF+MXF dual solution. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) was successfully applied in the sterilization of the drug-loaded hydrogels. The transmittance, refractive index, wettability and ionic permeability of the hydrogels remained within the required levels for SCLs application. The concentrations of the released DCF and MXF stayed above the IC50 and the MIC (for S. aureus and S. epidermidis) values, for 9 and 10 days, respectively.

drug,Bioinspired Imprinted PHEMA-Hydrogels for Ocular Delivery of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor Drugs,"Hydrogels with high affinity for carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor drugs have been designed trying to mimic the active site of the physiological metallo-enzyme receptor. Using hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as the backbone component, zinc methacrylate, 1- or 4-vinylimidazole (1VI or 4VI), and N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEAA) were combined at different ratios to reproduce in the hydrogels the cone-shaped cavity of the CA, which contains a Zn2+ ion coordinated to three histidine residues. 4VI resembles histidine functionality better than 1VI, and, consequently, pHEMA-ZnMA2 hydrogels bearing 4VI moieties were those with the greatest ability to host acetazolamide or ethoxzolamide (2 to 3 times greater network/water partition coefficient) and to sustain the release of these antiglaucoma drugs (50% lower release rate estimated by fitting to the square root kinetics). The use of acetazolamide as template during polymerization did not enhance the affinity of the network for the drugs. In addition to the remarkable improvement in the performance as controlled release systems, the biomimetic hydrogels were highly cytocompatible and possessed adequate oxygen permeability to be used as medicated soft contact lenses or inserts.
