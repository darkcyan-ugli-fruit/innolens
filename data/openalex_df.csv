emerging technologies,Poly(2-Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate) Hydrogels for Contact Lens Applications–A Review,"The emerging technology in biomedical engineering requires biocompatible materials, which are also referred to as biomaterials. For a material to be considered biocompatible, it should not interact with human tissues in a harmful way, and vice versa. Various properties of biocompatible materials, such as mechanical and optical properties, have to be considered for different biomedical applications. One of the most popular applications of biomaterials is for contact lenses. Hydrogels, specifically poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogels, are among the most popular ones in ophthalmologic applications, especially in soft contact lenses. This paper reviews the use of PHEMA hydrogels as one of the important biomaterials. The possible applications, properties, and manufacturing process of PHEMA hydrogels, especially in contact lens applications, are addressed. Many studies have shown that PHEMA hydrogels possess many advantages in contact lens applications and have promising development prospects.",2021-09-29,Kushendarsyah Saptaji,Nurlaely Rohmatul,Sampoerna University,ID,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

emerging technologies,Soft Lithography Using Nectar Droplets,"In spite of significant advances in replication technologies, methods to produce well-defined three-dimensional structures are still at its infancy. Such a limitation would be evident if we were to produce a large array of simple and, especially, compound convex lenses, also guaranteeing that their surfaces would be molecularly smooth. Here, we report a novel method to produce such structures by cloning the 3D shape of nectar drops, found widely in nature, using conventional soft lithography.The elementary process involves transfer of a thin patch of the sugar solution coated on a glass slide onto a hydrophobic substrate on which this patch evolves into a microdroplet. Upon the absorption of water vapor, such a microdroplet grows linearly with time, and its final size can be controlled by varying its exposure time to water vapor. At any stage of the evolution of the size of the drop, its shape can be cloned onto a soft elastomer by following the well-known methods of molding and cross-linking the same. A unique new science that emerges in our attempt to understand the transfer of the sugar patch and its evolution to a spherical drop is the elucidation of the mechanics underlying the contact of a deformable sphere against a solid support intervening a thin liquid film. A unique aspect of this work is to demonstrate that higher level structures can also be generated by transferring even smaller nucleation sites on the surface of the primary lenses and then allowing them to grow by absorption of water vapor. What results at the end is either a well-controlled distribution of smooth hemispherical lenses or compound structures that could have potential applications in the fundamental studies of contact mechanics, wettability, and even in optics.",2015-11-13,Saheli Biswas,Aditi Chakrabarti,Lehigh University,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

emerging technologies,Molecular-channel driven actuator with considerations for multiple configurations and color switching,"The ability to achieve simultaneous intrinsic deformation with fast response in commercially available materials that can safely contact skin continues to be an unresolved challenge for artificial actuating materials. Rather than using a microporous structure, here we show an ambient-driven actuator that takes advantage of inherent nanoscale molecular channels within a commercial perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer (PFSA) film, fabricated by simple solution processing to realize a rapid response, self-adaptive, and exceptionally stable actuation. Selective patterning of PFSA films on an inert soft substrate (polyethylene terephthalate film) facilitates the formation of a range of different geometries, including a 2D (two-dimensional) roll or 3D (three-dimensional) helical structure in response to vapor stimuli. Chemical modification of the surface allowed the development of a kirigami-inspired single-layer actuator for personal humidity and heat management through macroscale geometric design features, to afford a bilayer stimuli-responsive actuator with multicolor switching capability.",2018-02-05,Jiuke Mu,Gang Wang,Donghua University,CN,yes,"Yes.

emerging technologies,Wearable smart sensor systems integrated on soft contact lenses for wireless ocular diagnostics,"Abstract Wearable contact lenses which can monitor physiological parameters have attracted substantial interests due to the capability of direct detection of biomarkers contained in body fluids. However, previously reported contact lens sensors can only monitor a single analyte at a time. Furthermore, such ocular contact lenses generally obstruct the field of vision of the subject. Here, we developed a multifunctional contact lens sensor that alleviates some of these limitations since it was developed on an actual ocular contact lens. It was also designed to monitor glucose within tears, as well as intraocular pressure using the resistance and capacitance of the electronic device. Furthermore, in-vivo and in-vitro tests using a live rabbit and bovine eyeball demonstrated its reliable operation. Our developed contact lens sensor can measure the glucose level in tear fluid and intraocular pressure simultaneously but yet independently based on different electrical responses.",2017-04-27,Joohee Kim,Minji Kim,Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,KR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

emerging technologies,What we know about the scleral profile and its impact on contact lens fitting,"Scleral contact lens fitting has provided practitioners with one of the earliest pieces of evidence that the sclera was more often asymmetric than symmetric. Some preliminary observations such as different haptic alignment patterns over the sclera in 360 degrees, the appearance of fogging in the fluid chamber and excessive tear out-in flow through specific meridians, quadrants, or areas of the haptic provide evidence of some scleral asymmetry. The advent of technologies that allowed measurement of the scleral profile led to formal research confirming that only about 6% of scleras are symmetric, while the rest are toric, quad-specific, or irregular. This has an evident impact on how to focus scleral lens fitting. Measuring the scleral profile also provided us with true ocular sagittal height data for cord diameters beyond the cornea. Although high variability was expected in pathological eyes, healthy eyes also showed a wide range of ocular sagittal heights. Due to this variability among healthy eyes, a discussion has emerged on whether the one-size-fits-all approach to soft lens fitting is a proper strategy to fit the whole spectrum of sagittal heights. The traditional mode of selecting the parameters for custom soft lenses through corneal parameters is also questioned.",2022-07-11,Javier Rojas-Viñuela,Melanie J Frogozo,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

on-demand manufacturing,"Wearable sensors: modalities, challenges, and prospects","Wearable sensors have recently seen a large increase in both research and commercialization. However, success in wearable sensors has been a mix of both progress and setbacks. Most of commercial progress has been in smart adaptation of existing mechanical, electrical and optical methods of measuring the body. This adaptation has involved innovations in how to miniaturize sensing technologies, how to make them conformal and flexible, and in the development of companion software that increases the value of the measured data.

Current ophthalmic drug delivery systems are inadequate, particularly eye drops, which allow about 95% of the active substance to be lost through tear drainage. According to the literature, many interdisciplinary studies have been carried out on the ability of contact lenses to increase the penetration of topical therapeutic agents. Contact lenses limit drug loss by releasing the medicine into two layers of tears on either side of the contact lens, eventually extending the time of contact with the ocular surface. Thanks to weighted soft contact lenses, a continuous release of the drug over an extended period is possible. This article reviewed the various techniques to deliver medications through contact lenses, examining their advantages and disadvantages.

drug delivery,Development of ocular drug delivery systems using molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses,"Recently, significant advances have been made in order to optimize drug delivery to ocular tissues. The main problems in ocular drug delivery are poor bioavailability and uncontrollable drug delivery of conventional ophthalmic preparations (e.g. eye drops). Hydrogels have been investigated since 1965 as new ocular drug delivery systems. Increase of hydrogel loading capacity, optimization of drug residence time on the ocular surface and biocompatibility with the eye tissue has been the main focus of previous studies. Molecular imprinting technology provided the opportunity to fulfill the above-mentioned objectives. Molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses (SCLs) have high potentials as novel drug delivery systems for the treatment of eye disorders. This technique is used for the preparation of polymers with specific binding sites for a template molecule. Previous studies indicated that molecular imprinting technology could be successfully applied for the preparation of SCLs as ocular drug delivery systems. Previous research, particularly in vivo studies, demonstrated that molecular imprinting is a versatile and effective method in optimizing the drug release behavior and enhancing the loading capacity of SCLs as new ocular drug delivery systems. This review highlights various potentials of molecularly imprinted contact lenses in enhancing the drug-loading capacity and controlling the drug release, compared to other ocular drug delivery systems.

The use of soft contact lenses has been proposed as a method to deliver drugs to the eye in an efficient manner. The contact lenses restrict the drug from being lost to tear drainage by releasing the drug into two tear layers on either side of the contact lens, where it ultimately diffuses into the eye.

drug delivery,Ocular Drug Delivery into the Eyes Using Drug-Releasing Soft Contact Lens,"The impact of visual impairment, such as blindness, on quality of life is immeasurable. However, effective ocular drug delivery into the eyes has not yet been established, primarily due to the impermeability imposed by the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) based on the tight junctions and efflux transporters at the endothelium or the epithelium in oral or intravenous administration, as well as the dilution with tear fluid and excretion through the nasolacrimal duct in eye drop administration. Furthermore, intravitreous injections induce pain and fear in patients. Unmet medical needs persist in ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, innovative non-invasive administration methods should be developed. Drug-releasing soft contact lenses (DR-SCLs) affixed to the eye’s surface can continuously and locally deliver their loaded drugs to the eyes. The use of DR-SCLs is expected to greatly enhance the bioavailability and patient adherence to the drug regimen. It is known that several solute carrier (SLC) transporters are expressed in various parts of the eyes, including the cornea, the ciliary body, and the bulbar conjunctiva. Carrier-mediated transport through SLC transporters may occur in addition to passive diffusion. Moreover, nanoparticles can be loaded into DR-SCLs, offering various intelligent approaches based on modifications to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis/transcytosis or to control the loaded drug release within this delivery system. In this perspective review, I discuss the implementation and potential of DR-SCL-mediated ocular drug delivery, particularly focusing on low-molecular-weight compounds because of their fine distribution in living body, ease of handling, and ease of manufacturing.",2024-04-29,Toshihiko Tashima,,Hamamatsu Photonics (Japan),JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

Hydrogels are the leading materials of soft contact lenses because of their biocompatibility and transparent characteristic. In order to increase the amount of load drug and to control their release at the expected intervals, many strategies are developed to modify the conventional contact lens as well as the novel hydrogel contact lenses that include (i) polymeric hydrogels with controlled hydrophilic/hydrophobic copolymer ratio; (ii) hydrogels for inclusion of drugs in a colloidal structure dispersed in the contact lenses; (iii) ligand-containing hydrogels; (iv) molecularly imprinted polymeric hydrogels; (v) hydrogel with the surface containing multilayer structure for drugs loading and releasing.

drug delivery,A novel approach to achieve semi-sustained drug delivery to the eye through asymmetric loading of soft contact lenses,"Soft contact lenses are increasingly being explored as a vehicle for controlled delivery of ophthalmic drugs. However, traditional methods of drug-loading by soaking have limitations such as burst delivery and the release of drugs at the front side of the lens, leading to poor drug efficacy and systemic side effects. This study introduces a new methodology, termed asymmetric drug loading, whereby the ophthalmic drug 'Rebamipide' is attached to and released from the post-lens (=cornea-contacting) surface exclusively. The methodology involves using polymeric microparticles that carry a lipophilic crystalline ophthalmic drug at their surface. These drug-loaded microparticles first transfer the drug to the concave surface of the contact lens, and when worn, the drug is transferred again, now from the lens to the cornea. This is achieved through the diffusion of the drug from one hydrophobic microenvironment (the silicone moieties of the contact lens polymer network) to another hydrophobic microenvironment (the corneal epithelium) over a short pathway. The second drug transfer was observed and studied in experiments using an ex vivo porcine eye model. The results show that the drug amount that was absorbed by the cornea after applying the rebamipide-loaded contact lenses is approximately 3× (10.7 ± 3.1 μg) as much as the amount of rebamipide that gets transferred after the instillation of one eye drop (1% solution (p < 0.001).

drug delivery,Therapeutic Contact Lenses with Polymeric Vehicles for Ocular Drug Delivery: A Review,"The eye has many barriers with specific anatomies that make it difficult to deliver drugs to targeted ocular tissues, and topical administration using eye drops or ointments usually needs multiple instillations to maintain the drugs’ therapeutic concentration because of their low bioavailability. A drug-eluting contact lens is one of the more promising platforms for controllable ocular drug delivery, and, among various manufacturing methods for drug-eluting contact lenses, incorporation of novel polymeric vehicles with versatile features makes it possible to deliver the drugs in a sustained and extended manner. Using the diverse physicochemical properties of polymers for nanoparticles or implants that are selected according to the characteristics of drugs, enhancement of encapsulation efficiency and prolonged drug release are possible. Even though therapeutic contact lenses with polymeric vehicles allow us to achieve sustained ocular drug delivery, drug leaching during storage and distribution and the possibility of problems related to surface roughness due to the incorporated vehicles still need to be discussed before application in a real clinic.

In order to improve compliance and reduce user discomfort, a capacitive sensor was embedded on a soft contact lens of 200 μm thickness using commercially available bio-compatible lens material and a standard manufacturing process. The results indicated that the reconfigurable sensor interface achieved sensitivity and baseline tuning up to 120 pF while consuming only 110 μW power. The range and sensitivity tuning of the readout circuitry ensured a reliable operation with respect to sensor fabrication variations and independent calibration of the sensor baseline for individuals. The on-chip voltage scaling allowed the further extension of the detection range and prevented the implementation of large on-chip elements.

smart materials,Near‐Field Communication Powered Hydrogel‐Based Smart Contact Lens,"Abstract Nowadays, smart contact lenses (SCLs) display interesting features for healthcare monitoring; however, their comfort and practical usability strongly depend on the outermost material in contact with the eye. In this publication, the embedding of a custom‐made and thermoformed Near‐Field Communication based circuit in a conventional soft CL is presented. The circuit is composed of gold tracks on polyimide between thermoplastic polyurethane layers (insert), while the lens is based on industry standard double‐molding process of poly(2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with proven compatibility with corneal tissue. The lens shows stable geometrical parameters (bevel landing area) thus enabling a practical implementation. Finite element method models are used to optimize the thermoforming process in order to provide a stable and desired curvature of the insert before the embedding process. While the insert is designed to allow oxygen transmission at the center of the lens, a custom‐made ultra‐compact radio‐frequency antenna provides communication and wireless power transfer both in air and inside saline solutions. The successful combination of the intrinsic soft mechanical properties of the wirelessly powered electronic insert with conventional hydrogel materials and manufacturing processes delivers a practical solution for SCLs.

smart materials,Flow stabilization in wearable microfluidic sensors enables noise suppression,"Dilatometric strain sensors (DSS) that work based on detection of volume change in microfluidic channels; i) are highly sensitive to biaxial strain, ii) can be fabricated using only soft and transparent materials, and iii) are easy to integrate with smart-phones. These features are especially attractive for contact lens based intraocular pressure (IOP) sensing applications. The inherent flow stabilization of the microfluidic systems is an additional advantage suitable for filtering out rapid fluctuations. Here, we have demonstrated that the low-pass filtering in microfluidic sensors improves the signal-to-noise-ratio for ophthalmic applications. We have fabricated devices with a time constant in the range of 1-200 seconds. We have demonstrated that the device architecture and working liquid viscosity (10-866 cSt) are the two independent factors that determine the sensor time constant. We have developed an equivalent circuit model for the DSS that accurately represents the experimental results thus can be used as a computational model for design and development of microfluidic sensors.

Participants washed hands, underwent finger swabs, and inserted the lenses. After 45 minutes, lenses were removed aseptically and the posterior lens surfaces cultured.Thirty-eight subjects (average age, 30.9 ± 12.5 years) participated in this study. Overall, the level of back surface contamination was low for both lens materials, ranging from 0 to 43 colony-forming unit (CFU)/lens for the silicone hydrogel and 0 to 17 CFU/lens for the hydrogel lenses. The proportion of lenses with zero back surface contamination ranged from 16 to 64% for silicone hydrogel lenses and 28 to 64% for hydrogel lenses. Contact lenses from conventional packaging containing EDTA had 3.38 times increased risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 11.11; P = .05) of contamination being present compared with lenses from Smart Touch packaging with EDTA. Contact lenses from conventional packaging without EDTA had 3.4 times increased risk (95% CI, 1.02 to 11.36; P = .05) of contamination being present compared with Smart Touch packaging without EDTA, and silicone hydrogel lenses had a 6.28 times increased risk (95% CI, 1.65 to 23.81; P = .007) of contamination being present compared with hydrogels. The median (interquartile range) number of bacteria isolated from fingers used to perform lens insertion after handwashing but before lens insertion was not significantly different between the silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses (63.7 [204.2] vs. 59 [84.5], P = .09). Finger contamination was not significantly associated with lens contamination in the presence or absence of EDTA.Smart Touch Technology packaging was effective in reducing the proportion of contaminated lenses.

lens innovation,Tear exchange and contact lenses: A review,"Tear exchange beneath a contact lens facilitates ongoing fluid replenishment between the ocular surface and the lens. This exchange is considerably lower during the wear of soft lenses compared with rigid lenses. As a result, the accumulation of tear film debris and metabolic by-products between the cornea and a soft contact lens increases, potentially leading to complications. Lens design innovations have been proposed, but no substantial improvement in soft lens tear exchange has been reported. Researchers have determined post-lens tear exchange using several methods, notably fluorophotometry. However, due to technological limitations, little remains known about tear hydrodynamics around the lens and, to-date, true tear exchange with contact lenses has not been shown. Further knowledge regarding tear exchange could be vital in aiding better contact lens design, with the prospect of alleviating certain adverse ocular responses. This article reviews the literature to-date on the significance, implications and measurement of tear exchange with contact lenses. El intercambio de lágrima bajo las lentes de contacto facilita la reposición continua de fluido entre la superficie ocular y las lentes. Dicho intercambio es considerablemente menor con el uso de lentes blandas en lugar de rígidas. Como resultado, se incrementa la acumulación de desechos de la película de lágrimas y los sub-productos metabólicos entre la córnea y las lentes de contacto blandas, lo que conlleva complicaciones potenciales. Se han propuesto innovaciones en el diseño de las lentes, pero no se ha reportado ninguna mejora sustancial en lo referente al intercambio de lágrima con las lentes de contacto blandas.

lens innovation,Contact Lens Fitting Profile in Portugal in 2005: Strategies for First Fits and Refits,"To evaluate the standards of contact lens practice in Portugal, with particular attention paid to the characteristics of first fits and refits regarding aspects such as symptoms of dryness, overnight wear, silicone hydrogel and multifocal prescriptions, and care systems.A questionnaire was distributed to 300 contact lens practitioners in Portugal, and they were asked to complete them with the following first 10 fittings (only right eye of each patient). Fifty-six questionnaires were returned to total 529 fittings.The mean age of contact lens wearers was 28.1 +/- 10.1 years, and 94.4% of the wearers were fitted with soft contact lenses (67.9% hydrogel lenses, 21.2% silicone hydrogel lenses, and 5.2% biomimetic soft contact lenses). Sixty percent of patients wore their contact lenses for 9 to 12 hours per day. The lenses were replaced on a monthly basis in 71% of cases, and 82.8% of wearers used a multipurpose solution for lens cleaning and disinfection. Significant differences were found between first fits and refits regarding the prevalence of dryness symptoms (higher incidence of frequent symptoms in the evening in the refitting group, P<0.01, chi2), replacement schedule (lower incidence of monthly disposable lenses in refits compared to first fits, P<0.05, chi2), and care regimen (lower incidence of multipurpose solutions and higher incidence of hydrogen peroxide in refits, P<0.01, chi2).Statistical analysis of the current trends in the Portuguese contact lens fitting profile showed that contact lens practitioners in Portugal are receptive to use innovations in contact lens products, such as silicone hydrogel and biomimetic materials, and daily-disposable contact lenses to refit patients who have not succeeded with previous lenses. Multifocal lenses also experienced a significant increase in their prevalence among refits and new fits. Rigid gas-permeable materials maintained and even experienced a slight increase in refits. Conversely, there is still a low incidence of extended-wear prescriptions, most of them being made with low-Dk soft contact lenses.",2007-03-01,José Manuel González‐Méijome,Jorge Jorge,University of Minho,PT,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses the fitting profiles and practices for soft contact lenses, focusing on innovative materials like silicone hydrogel, which align with the company's research objective related to lens innovation and emerging technologies.

lens innovation,Taking care of the future for contact lenses,"Contact lenses have been around a long time. It is over 125 years since Fick first demonstrated that placing a glass shell onto the eye1 brought clinical benefits for his patients and although it took a little while for the concept to enter the mainstream consciousness, Tuohy's invention of the corneal lens2 and Wichterle and Lim's later development of soft hydrogels,3 paved the way for contact lenses to become a major vision correction option. How many people actually wear these devices worldwide, is a number that is difficult to accurately determine, yet estimates for the value of the market are offered regularly, with the current figure standing at around US$7.4 billion.4 The suggestion that this represents a modest growth trend relative to previous years is welcome news to an industry that, recently, has felt itself to be in a period of stagnation. Maintaining this momentum in the years to come will require initiative. Expanding the business into regions where increasing disposable income allows the purchase of discretionary items such as contact lenses to be contemplated, is one such strategy but these new markets could well be dwarfed if the potential offered by some promised technological innovations is realised. Contact lenses have a unique status among medical devices because they are in close proximity to the vascular system, immersed in a bodily fluid and of course, located in the visual pathway. On top of this they are relatively non-invasive and readily removable. This combination of properties makes them attractive vehicles to support a whole range of applications extending from drug delivery and bio-sensing, through radiation protection and secure identification to visual augmentation and virtual reality. Implementation time frames for these possibilities vary considerably and while some, such as intra-ocular pressure monitoring, are already available,5 it is by no means certain that all will eventually be practical. Nevertheless, the landscape of contact lens use is beginning to look very different than it ever has before because substantial groups of people who have no intrinsic need for vision correction may soon find them useful. While the industry will be drawn towards the fiscal benefits of such an expansion in wearer numbers, it is evident that there could well be consequences which impact on public health. Irrespective of their function, all contact lenses require skilled fitting, wearer education and appropriate follow up. In the UK and other jurisdictions around the world, this process is regulated and rightly so; but how will these systems cope if there were to be a massive increase in demand? Substantially more appointment slots would be required per practice, both for fitting and after care, and the higher proportion of elderly individuals (drug delivery, bio-sensing) would tend to lengthen average chair time, due to the extra attention that such consultations generally demand. Ensuring the availability of sufficient human resources, with appropriate skills, to cover these new cohorts will require careful thought and forward planning at both the practice level and within professional training institutions. Unfortunately, current experience suggests that getting these staffing projections right will not be enough to prevent serious problems from occurring. Wearers of contemporary, plano-powered, cosmetic lenses commonly obtain supplies from unregistered sources and thus forgo the opportunity for usage advice.6, 7 Accordingly, unsafe practices such as lens sharing and inadequate disinfection are frequent occurrences as, sadly, are corneal infections. This scenario will undoubtedly be replicated and magnified, as other mass appeal lens types become available. Even in circumstances where clinical care is optimal, more wearers inevitably means more cases of infection. Although daily wear rates of microbial keratitis (MK) are relatively low,8 increasing the wearer base will proportionately raise the numbers who present with sight threatening corneal ulcers. Also, because some applications will support continuous functionality (e.g. drug delivery) or perhaps, tempt the user to disappear indefinitely into an immersive environment, there is likely to be more extended and continuous wear undertaken. Given that overnight use increases the risk of MK, a rise in the overall rate of infectious keratitis for the population would be expected to follow. These risks appear real enough, but it is in no-one's interest to allow them to undermine the possible benefits appearing on the horizon. It is therefore imperative to take steps that will limit the potential for negative events. In the general enthusiasm surrounding innovative applications, it is easy to forget that the focus of this activity must be on the behaviour of the lens itself, since that is what will eventually govern overall success. Solving the existing problems of contact lens wear remains the goal therefore and research must be prioritised that expands the knowledge base surrounding their interaction with the ocular environment. Examples of two such phenomena appear in the current issue of OPO in work by Vincent et al. and Alghamdi et al.9, 10 The learnings from these studies can then form the basis for designing improved devices that are less impactful. Along the way, critical information relevant to enhancing safety will certainly emerge and this must be efficiently communicated to clinicians and wearers. Carnt and Stapleton11admirably demonstrate this process in their review of strategies for reducing the risk of a significant cause of sight threatening infection, namely Acanthamoeba keratitis. Their commentary indicates how giving clinicians an understanding of the dangers of tap water and “topping off” of disinfection solutions can help them modify behaviour among contact lens wearers and hopefully experience fewer cases of visual loss. As we look ahead and contemplate the next 125 years of contact lens wear, the vision contains much that is exciting. Ensuring that success can be achieved in the future however, depends crucially on solving the problems of today.
