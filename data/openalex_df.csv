manufacturing,Biomedical applications of hydrogels: A review of patents and commercial products,"Hydrogels have become very popular due to their unique properties such as high water content, softness, flexibility and biocompatibility. Natural and synthetic hydrophilic polymers can be physically or chemically cross-linked in order to produce hydrogels. Their resemblance to living tissue opens up many opportunities for applications in biomedical areas. Currently, hydrogels are used for manufacturing contact lenses, hygiene products, tissue engineering scaffolds, drug delivery systems and wound dressings. This review provides an analysis of their main characteristics and biomedical applications. From Wichterle's pioneering work to the most recent hydrogel-based inventions and products on the market, it provides the reader with a detailed introduction to the topic and perspective on further potential developments.",2014-11-29,Enrica Caló,Vitaliy V.

manufacturing,Quality Control in Soft Contact Lens Manufacture — A Case Study,"Over the past few years considerable attention has been focused on the implementation and usage of SQC techniques and the need to increase awareness and knowledge of SQC has been highlighted by many authorities. The work reported here was part of a large research project carried out to investigate the barriers to acceptance of production management techniques in UK manufacturing industry and addresses the quality control/scrap problems faced by a small company manufacturing soft contact lenses. The case study demonstrates the benefits that can be gained, even when applied in a relatively simple manner, from using mean and range charts. The problems identified were those concerned with the manufacturing operations and the raw materials used and it was the use of SQC techniques which helped to identify these problems.",1988-01-01,Amrik S.

manufacturing,Multistate Outbreak of Fusarium Keratitis Associated With Use of a Contact Lens Solution,"Fusarium keratitis is a serious corneal infection, most commonly associated with corneal injury. Beginning in March 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received multiple reports of Fusarium keratitis among contact lens wearers.To define the specific activities, contact lens hygiene practices, or products associated with this outbreak.Epidemiological investigation of Fusarium keratitis occurring in the United States. A confirmed case was defined as keratitis with illness onset after June 1, 2005, with no history of recent ocular trauma and a corneal culture growing Fusarium species. Data were obtained by patient and ophthalmologist interviews for case patients and neighborhood-matched controls by trained personnel. Available Fusarium isolates from patients' clinical and environmental specimens were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Environmental sampling for Fusarium was conducted at a contact lens solution manufacturing plant.Keratitis infection with Fusarium species.As of June 30, 2006, we identified 164 confirmed case patients in 33 states and 1 US territory. Median age was 41 years (range, 12-83 years). Corneal transplantation was required or planned in 55 (34%). One hundred fifty-four (94%) of the confirmed case patients wore soft contact lenses. Forty-five case patients and 78 controls were included in the case-control study. Case patients were significantly more likely than controls to report using a specific contact lens solution, ReNu with MoistureLoc (69% vs 15%; odds ratio, 13.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.1-119.5). The prevalence of reported use of ReNu MultiPlus solution was similar between case patients and controls (18% vs 20%; odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-2.8). Fusarium was not recovered from the factory, warehouse, solution filtrate, or unopened solution bottles; production of implicated lots was not clustered in time. Among 39 isolates tested, at least 10 different Fusarium species were identified, comprising 19 unique multilocus genotypes.The findings from this investigation indicate that this outbreak of Fusarium keratitis was associated with use of ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution. Contact lens users should not use ReNu with MoistureLoc.",2006-08-22,Douglas C. Chang,Gavin B. Grant,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Manufacturing of Soft Contact Lenses Using Reusable and Reliable Cyclic Olefin Copolymer Moulds,"We present experimental evidence of reusable, reliable cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) moulds in soft contact lens manufacturing. The moulds showed high performance surface roughness characteristics despite >20 kW exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light from repeated use. Ultra-precision manufacturing techniques were used to fabricate transparent COC mould inserts and to produce soft contact lenses from liquid monomer compositions. Both polymer and silicone hydrogels were fabricated with more than 60 individual uses of the moulds. White light interferometry measured the surface roughness (Sa) of the COC moulds to be almost unchanged before and after repeated use (Sa 16.3 nm before vs. 16.6 nm after). The surface roughness of the prototyped lenses and that of commercially available soft contact lenses were then compared by white light interferometry. The surface roughness of the lenses was also nearly unchanged, despite undergoing more than 60 uses of the COC moulds (lens Sa 24.4 nm before vs. after Sa 26.5 nm). By comparison the roughness of the commercial lenses ranged from 9.3−28.5 nm, including conventional and silicone lenses, indicating that the reusable COC moulds produced competitive surface properties. In summary, COC moulds have potential as reusable and reliable mould inserts in the manufacturing of soft contact lenses, yet maintain high quality optical surfaces even after sustained exposure to UV light.",2022-11-02,Christopher S.

manufacturing,Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels Reinforced with Nanocellulose for Ophthalmic Applications: General Characteristics and Optical Properties,"Globally, uncorrected refractive errors are one of the main causes of visual impairment, and contact lenses form an important part of modern day eye care and culture. Several hydrogels with varying physicochemical properties are in use to manufacture soft contact lenses. Hydrogels are generally too soft and reinforcement with appropriate materials is desirable to achieve high water content without compromising mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a highly transparent macroporous hydrogel with water content >90%, by combining poly(vinyl alcohol) with nanocellulose. Furthermore, the results show that the composite hydrogel has refractive index close to that of water and very good UV-blocking properties.",2016-12-01,Gopi Krishna Tummala,Ramiro Rojas,Uppsala University,SE,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Impact of Manufacturing Technology and Material Composition on the Clinical Performance of Hydrogel Lenses,"Purpose. To establish the clinical impact of three different methods of manufacture used to produce soft contact lenses. Methods. Clinical performance of five lens types was investigated by undertaking a prospective, double-masked, randomized, crossover study. Three of the lenses were made from poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) by three different manufacturing processes (lathing, spin casting, and cast molding), and the remaining two lenses were cast molded from different materials—hydroxyethyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid and hydroxyethyl methacrylate/glycerol methacrylate (HEMA/GMA). All lenses were specially fabricated for this work at the same manufacturing plant. Thirty-four soft contact lens wearers wore each lens for 1 month on a daily-wear basis. Several clinical variables, such as ocular response, visual acuity, lens fitting, prelens tear film, lens surface dehydration, subjective response, and protein deposition, were measured. Results. In general, the spun-cast pHEMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other pHEMA lenses. This lens induced significantly more limbal and conjunctival hyperemia than the cast-molded lens and provided poorer low contrast visual acuity (LCVA) than the other two lenses. It dehydrated more and had the least on-eye movement. However, the spun-cast lens deposited the least protein of the pHEMA lenses. In general, the HEMA/GMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other cast-molded lenses. LCVA was worse with this lens, and subjective responses showed that this lens was thought to give the worst visual performance of the cast-molded lenses. It was also thought to be the most difficult lens to handle. Significantly more breakages occurred with this lens than any other. Conclusions. Overall, this work has shown that manufacturing method and material composition have a fundamental effect on many clinical properties of a lens. Therefore, method of manufacture is also an important consideration in the overall production of a soft lens.",2004-06-01,Carole Maldonado‐Codina,Nathan Efron,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Therapeutic Contact Lenses with Polymeric Vehicles for Ocular Drug Delivery: A Review,"The eye has many barriers with specific anatomies that make it difficult to deliver drugs to targeted ocular tissues, and topical administration using eye drops or ointments usually needs multiple instillations to maintain the drugs’ therapeutic concentration because of their low bioavailability. A drug-eluting contact lens is one of the more promising platforms for controllable ocular drug delivery, and, among various manufacturing methods for drug-eluting contact lenses, incorporation of novel polymeric vehicles with versatile features makes it possible to deliver the drugs in a sustained and extended manner. Using the diverse physicochemical properties of polymers for nanoparticles or implants that are selected according to the characteristics of drugs, enhancement of encapsulation efficiency and prolonged drug release are possible. Even though therapeutic contact lenses with polymeric vehicles allow us to achieve sustained ocular drug delivery, drug leaching during storage and distribution and the possibility of problems related to surface roughness due to the incorporated vehicles still need to be discussed before application in a real clinic. This review highlights the overall trends in methodology to develop therapeutic contact lenses with polymeric vehicles and discusses the limitations including comparison to cosmetically tinted soft contact lenses.",2018-07-01,Seung Woo Choi,Jaeyun Kim,Sungkyunkwan University,KR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Development of Contact Lenses and Their Worldwide Use,"The concept of applying a lens to the cornea as a refractive appliance was first proposed in the early 19th century. By 1888, glass scleral lenses for the correction of optical defects and irregularities were manufactured and used. New materials, especially soft hydrogel lenses and rigid gas-permeable lenses, became available in the 20th century and allowed comfortable contact lenses to be made in any design needed. By the 21st century, the increasing use of silicone hydrogel lenses to address the oxygen need of the cornea has led to increased worldwide use. Of the 125 million global contact lens wearers, most are female and relatively young. Soft lenses are by far the dominant modality used, with silicone hydrogel lenses taking an increasing share of new fittings, particularly for overnight wear. Microbial keratitis, although relatively uncommon, remains the most serious potential complication for these lens wearers. Ongoing basic research, more powerful antimicrobial agents, and the development of safer lens materials are helping to alleviate this problem.",2007-11-01,James E. Key,,Bausch & Lomb (France),FR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses the development and evolution of contact lenses, particularly soft lenses, which aligns with the company's focus on soft contact lens manufacturing and related processes.

manufacturing,Overnight Corneal Reshaping versus Soft Disposable Contact Lenses: Vision-Related Quality-of-Life Differences From a Randomized Clinical Trial,"Purpose. The purpose of this article is to evaluate patients' visual acuity, symptoms, and perceptions of vision-related quality of life in a randomized crossover clinical trial of overnight corneal reshaping (OCR) and daily wear soft lenses (SCL). Methods. Qualified subjects were randomly assigned to wear one mode of contact lens for 8 weeks and then, after a washout period, they wore the alternate mode for 8 weeks. On concluding each contact lens wear mode, subjects completed the NEI-RQL42 questionnaire. During the SCL mode, subjects wore lenses during their waking hours. During the OCR mode, subjects wore lenses only while sleeping. Soft lenses were Biomedics 55 2-week disposable lenses. OCR lenses were CRT lenses by Paragon. (Three subjects were fit with custom-designed OCR lenses in Boston XO material, manufactured by Art Optical.) LogMAR acuity was measured and slit lamp evaluation was performed at specified intervals during follow up. After completing both phases of the study, patients chose which mode they preferred. Results. Of 81 enrolled patients, 65 completed both phases and 16 dropped out during the study. Significant differences (p < 0.01) favoring SCL wear included better visual acuity and less trouble with glare. Significant differences (p < 0.01) favoring OCR wear included less activity limitations, less trouble with symptoms, and less dependence on refractive correction. Of 65 completing both phases, 44 preferred the OCR lenses and 21 preferred the soft lenses. Subjects who preferred the OCR lenses were less myopic and had steeper K readings at baseline, and showed less difference between visual acuity during OCR wear and visual acuity with SCL. Conclusion. In subjects with mild myopia who experienced both SCL and OCR, better visual acuity and less glare resulted from SCL wear, whereas activity limitations, symptoms, and dependence on refractive correction were less troublesome with OCR wear. When the study was completed, 67.7% chose OCR lenses worn only while sleeping, whereas 32.3% preferred 2-week disposable soft lenses worn during the day as their preferred correction.",2005-10-01,Michael Lipson,Alan Sugar,University of Michigan,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,A Wirelessly Powered Smart Contact Lens with Reconfigurable Wide Range and Tunable Sensitivity Sensor Readout Circuitry,"This study presented a wireless smart contact lens system that was composed of a reconfigurable capacitive sensor interface circuitry and wirelessly powered radio-frequency identification (RFID) addressable system for sensor control and data communication. In order to improve compliance and reduce user discomfort, a capacitive sensor was embedded on a soft contact lens of 200 μm thickness using commercially available bio-compatible lens material and a standard manufacturing process. The results indicated that the reconfigurable sensor interface achieved sensitivity and baseline tuning up to 120 pF while consuming only 110 μW power. The range and sensitivity tuning of the readout circuitry ensured a reliable operation with respect to sensor fabrication variations and independent calibration of the sensor baseline for individuals. The on-chip voltage scaling allowed the further extension of the detection range and prevented the implementation of large on-chip elements. The on-lens system enabled the detection of capacitive variation caused by pressure changes in the range of 2.25 to 30 mmHg and hydration level variation from a distance of 1 cm using incident power from an RFID reader at 26.5 dBm.",2017-01-07,Jin‐Chern Chiou,Shun-Hsi Hsu,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,TW,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Initial in Vivo Tear Protein Deposition on Individual Hydrogel Contact Lenses,"We investigated and compared the initial composition, morphology, and time course of deposits on individual soft contact lenses of different water contents and surface charges in order to evaluate the potential for antigenic reactions and to predict the optimal frequency of lens replacement. Newly manufactured lenses were worn for graduated periods of time from 1 min to 8 h by subjects who were first adapted to daily wear soft lenses. The morphology and composition of the deposits were analyzed by histological staining, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) with silver nitrate staining, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The protein bands of the acrylamide gels were divided according to their molecular weights into six groups which have been defined in the literature from tear analyses by electrophoretic techniques and include lysozyme, proteins migrating faster than albumin (PMFA), protein G, albumin, lactoferrin, and other proteins heavier than albumin such as Ig-G and secretory Ig-A. Specific proteins (lysozyme, PMFA, and protein G) were detected on individual lenses after as little as 1 min of wear. There was an increasing amount of protein deposited as the wearing time increased. Differences in the rates and amounts of deposition were more dependent on lens water content and ionic characteristics than on intersubject differences. Such early significant protein deposition may occur in wearers of disposable lenses as well as in those subject to complications due to accumulation of protein.",1990-07-01,Charles Leahy,Robert B. Mandell,New England College of Optometry,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Surface chemical structure for soft contact lenses as a function of polymer processing,"The surface chemistry and topography of cast-molded Etafilcon-A and doubled-sided lathed Etafilcon-A soft contact lenses were determined to be significantly different. The variations in surface chemical and morphologic structure between the two lenses were the result of contact lens manufacturing methods. The surface of the cast-molded Etafilcon-A had a consistently less rough surface compared to the doubled sided lathed Etafilcon-A as determined by atomic force microscopy. The surface of the doubled sided lathed Etafilcon-A contained primarily silicone and wax contamination in addition to minute amounts of HEMA. The cast-molded Etafilcon-A had an elemental and chemical content which was consistent with the polymer stoichiometry. Contact angle wettability profiles revealed inherent wettability differences between the two lenses types. The cast-molded Etafilcon-A had an inherently greater water wettability, polarity, and critical surface tension. This means that these two lenses cannot be compared as similar or identical lens materials in terms of surface composition. The manufacturing method used to produce a soft contact lens directly determines the surface elemental and chemical structure as well as the morphology of the finished lens material. These results suggest possible differences in the clinical comfort, spoilage, and lubricity felt during patient wear. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",1996-09-01,George L. Grobe,Paul L. Valint,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It discusses the impact of manufacturing methods on the surface chemistry and properties of soft contact lenses, specifically Etafilcon-A, which aligns with the company’s research objectives related to manufacturing and mold processes.",1996
manufacturing,Trends in Australian contact lens prescribing during the first decade of the 21st Century (2000–2009),"The aim was to document contact lens prescribing trends in Australia between 2000 and 2009.A survey of contact lens prescribing trends was conducted each year between 2000 and 2009. Australian optometrists were asked to provide information relating to 10 consecutive contact lens fittings between January and March each year.Over the 10-year survey period, 1,462 practitioners returned survey forms representing a total of 13,721 contact lens fittings. The mean age (+/- SD) of lens wearers was 33.2 +/- 13.6 years and 65 per cent were female. Between 2006 and 2009, rigid lens new fittings decreased from 18 to one per cent. Low water content lenses reduced from 11.5 to 3.2 per cent of soft lens fittings between 2000 and 2008. Between 2005 and 2009, toric lenses and multifocal lenses represented 26 and eight per cent, respectively, of all soft lenses fitted. Daily disposable, one- to two-week replacement and monthly replacement lenses accounted for 11.6, 30.0 and 46.5 per cent of all soft lens fittings over the survey period, respectively. The proportion of new soft fittings and refittings prescribed as extended wear has generally declined throughout the past decade. Multi-purpose lens care solutions dominate the market. Rigid lenses and monthly replacement soft lenses are predominantly worn on a full-time basis, whereas daily disposable soft lenses are mainly worn part-time.This survey indicates that technological advances, such as the development of new lens materials, manufacturing methods and lens designs, and the availability of various lens replacement options, have had a significant impact on the contact lens market during the first decade of the 21st Century.",2010-06-23,Nathan Efron,Philip B.

manufacturing,Impact of manufacturing technology and material composition on the mechanical properties of hydrogel contact lenses,"Abstract Hydrogel materials are not only different as a result of different co‐monomer compositions but also as a result of the manufacturing method used to produce them. Hydrogel contact lenses fabricated by different methods are subjected to markedly different processing steps, which are likely to affect the resultant material network structure of a lens. The mechanical performance of five soft contact lens types was investigated using one conventional technique (tensile test) and three novel techniques (probe, tear and ball milling tests). The five lens groups consisted of three polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA) lenses which were each manufactured by a different technique: lathing, spin‐casting and cast‐moulding, a HEMA/methacrylic acid (HEMA/MAA) cast‐moulded lens and a HEMA/glycerol methacrylate (HEMA/GMA) cast‐moulded lens. Overall, the results show that the best mechanical performance is obtained for the pHEMA lenses, with some differences occurring between the lenses. The HEMA/GMA lens showed the worst performance.",2004-10-19,Carole Maldonado‐Codina,Nathan Efron,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It discusses the impact of manufacturing techniques on the mechanical properties of hydrogel contact lenses, which directly aligns with the research objective focused on soft contact lenses and their manufacturing processes.",2004
manufacturing,Influence of Soft Contact Lens Design on Clinical Performance,"A double-masked, randomized study in four parts was conducted to evaluate the effect of varying certain soft contact lens design parameters on clinical performance. The effects of varying back optic zone radius (BOZR) (8.20 to 9.00 mm), back surface design (monocurve, bicurve, aspheric), edge thickness (0.12 to 0.24 mm), and back vertex power (+1.00 to −6.00 D) were investigated using test lenses manufactured in a high water content material. In each part of the study, between 20 and 35 volunteer subjects wore a range of lenses which were assessed after >30 min settling periods. Postblink movement and lens ""tightness"" as assessed by the push-up test were unaffected by the variation in BOZR. Lenses of flatter BOZR centered lower and more temporally than steeper lenses. Lenses of similar back surface sagittal depth, but differing in terms of back surface design, did not center the same; the monocurve lenses decentered more than bicurve or aspheric lenses. Edge thickness had no significant effect on comfort or lens fit. Plus power lenses resulted in more postblink movement than minus lenses of similar power. The results are discussed in relation to the design and fitting of soft contact lenses.",1993-05-01,Graeme P. Young,Brien A. Holden,UNSW Sydney,AU,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It investigates various design parameters of soft contact lenses, which aligns with the company's focus on soft contact lens manufacturing and related topics.

manufacturing,A Comparison of Wavefront Aberrations in Eyes Wearing Different Types of Soft Contact Lenses,"Purpose. The purpose of this study is to investigate the optical quality of eyes wearing different types of soft contact lenses (sCLs) using wavefront aberrometry. Method. A psychophysical aberrometer (WFA1000B; BriteEye, SuZhou, China) was used to measure wavefront aberrations for 56 eyes of 28 subjects under four conditions: 1) without contact lenses (non-CL), 2) with lathe-cut contact lenses (lathe-cut CL; Shuliang, Weicon Optics, Shanghai, China), 3) with cast-molded contact lenses (cast-molded CL; Vistavue, J&J Vision Care, U.S.), and 4) with spun-cast contact lenses (spun-cast CL; Lanfenzhiji, Justcome Optics, Beijing, China). The three types of sCLs were made from different materials and lens design. The root mean square (RMS) values of the wavefront aberrations and individual Zernike aberrations were calculated and compared among the CL-wearing conditions. Results. Astigmatism was not significantly changed by any of the three soft contact lenses when compared with the non-CL condition. However, a significant difference in the RMS values of higher-order aberrations was observed between the lens types (F = 8.29, p < 0.0001). Induced higher-order aberrations were found for both the cast-molded CL and the spun-cast CL conditions. There were significant differences in the aberrations in each of the higher orders between the CL conditions (F = 3.77, p = 0.011 for third order; F = 5.31, p = 0.002 for fourth order; F = 13.86, p < 0.0001 for fifth and higher orders). More higher-order Zernike aberrations such as coma and spherical aberration were induced by cast-molded CLs and/or the spun-cast CLs. Conclusion. Wavefront aberrations in the eyes with soft contact lenses vary from one individual lens type to another. Although the variation in wavefront aberrations could be attributed to the differences in the methods of manufacture, influences from other factors such as the lens material and lens design could not be excluded and deserve further investigation.",2006-10-01,Jiang Hong-jun,Dan Wang,Peking University,CN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Omafilcon A (Proclear) soft contact lenses in a dry eye population.,"We conducted a 3-month, randomized, comparative cross-over study to evaluate the clinical performance of lenses manufactured from omafilcon A on subjects with signs and symptoms of dry eye. The subjects' own daily wear soft lenses were used as controls.Seventy-six subjects with objective evidence of dry eye, as defined in the NEI/Industry Workshop Report 1995, were fit with either the omafilcon A lenses (Proclear) or new control lenses. Subjects wore the lenses for 6 weeks and then crossed over to bilateral wear of the other lenses for an additional 6 weeks. During each part of the study, we examined subjects at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 weeks. Signs and symptoms of dry eye were evaluated, and on-eye dehydration of the lens was assessed.When the subjects were wearing the omafilcon A lenses, there was a statistically significant improvement in a number of subjective parameters including comfort, dryness, frequency of eye irritation, and frequency of burning. We found significantly less on-eye dehydration of the lens and fluorescein corneal staining with the omafilcon A lenses.This study indicated that the daily wear of omafilcon A lenses provided better comfort, fewer symptoms, less on-eye dehydration, and less fluorescein corneal staining than other soft daily wear contact lenses in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye.",1999-01-01,Michael A.

manufacturing,Quantification of Intramolecular Cyclization in Branched Copolymers by<sup>1</sup>H NMR Spectroscopy,"Statistical copolymerization of a monovinyl with a divinyl monomer leads to macroscopic gels, microgels, or soluble branched copolymers, depending on the precise reaction conditions. This approach is widely used for the manufacture of soft contact lenses and also to prepare various biomedical hydrogels for the separation and purification of proteins, DNA, etc. According to Flory–Stockmayer theory, gelation should occur in such copolymerizations if there is more than 0.50 fully reacted divinyl comonomer per primary chain. However, many experimental studies indicate significant deviations from this classical theory, which are generally believed to be due to wastage of the divinyl comonomer via intramolecular cyclization. Unfortunately, experimental verification of this side reaction has proven elusive for the past seven decades. In the present study, we use a disulfide-based cleavable bifunctional comonomer to undertake the first experimental quantification of the extent of intramolecular cyclization in nonlinear methacrylic copolymers using 1H NMR spectroscopy.",2012-03-13,Julien Rosselgong,Steven P.

manufacturing,PDMS and its Suitability for Analytical Microfluidic Devices,"Poly(dimethylsiloxane) also known as PDMS is used in a wide range of biomedical applications. These range from implants through catheters to soft contact lenses. Therefore, it is understandable that PDMS has been extensively tested for these purposes. In past years, the microfluidics has moved from predominantly silicon and glass structures towards polymers due to their ease of manufacturing and moderate cost. PDMS has gained a lot of attention in various analytical applications. However, the testing of its suitability for such applications has not been as thorough as in the biomedical applications, perhaps relying on the experiments from that field. Microfluidic PDMS structures are more and more popular in various analytical devices. Such devices consume less reagents and can work with lower sample volumes. On the other hand, the surface-to-sample-volume ratio becomes larger. That increases the influence of material properties on the actual measurement. Some of the challenges include adsorption, diffusion, surface roughness, permeability and elasticity of PDMS, which are discussed in this paper.",2006-08-01,Johana Kuncová-Kallio,Pasi Kallio,Tampere University,FI,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses the properties and applications of PDMS, which is directly applicable to soft contact lenses.

manufacturing,Noncontact Tonometry through Soft Contact Lenses,"Under some circumstances it is advantageous to measure intraocular pressure (IOP) without removing soft contact lenses. In this study comparisons have been made between IOP measurements [using a noncontact tonometer (NCT)] with and without soft contact lenses on the eye. The influence of lenses of different water content, lens design, lens power, method of manufacture, and lens center thickness was examined. The most important parameter affecting the results was center thickness. It was shown that reliable and valid IOP findings can be obtained using a NCT with soft lenses on the eye when center thickness is less than 0.15 mm.

manufacturing,Contact lens induced keratitis associated with contact lens wear,"To evaluate clinical characteristics, risk factors, management and outcome of contact lens induced keratitis (CLIK) associated with contact lens wear.The study comprised all consecutive patients presenting with contact lens related presumed microbial keratitis during a 12-month period at our department. Detailed demographic data, type of contact lens, duration of lens wear, wearing schedule and lens hygiene were derived from a self-administered questionnaire. Severity of ulcer, corneal scrapings, treatment and final outcome were evaluated.27 patients with CLIK, some of which may have been sterile peripheral infiltrates, due to contact lens wear were detected. In the majority of the cases patients had used disposable soft contact lenses (89%) and most of them had a daily wearing schedule (78%). 51.8% patients cleaned their lenses regularly. 6 (22%) applied no disinfection since their lenses were disposable on removal. In 3 of our cases with CLIK, penetrating keratoplasty had to be performed.Disposable contact lenses seem to have been a predisposing factor for contact lens induced keratitis also when used on a daily wear schedule. Insufficient contact lens care products and/or manufacturing characteristics may be responsible for CLIK, which is also observed in otherwise compliant contact lens users. In 3 of our patients with CLIK keratoplasty became necessary, indicating that contact lens induced keratitis may result in severe corneal complications.",2001-10-01,Irene Dejaco‐Ruhswurm,Ursula Scholz,Medical University of Vienna,AT,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Comparison of contrast sensitivity in different soft contact lenses and spectacles.,"To compare the visual performance of soft contact lenses and spectacles.Twenty eyes of ten patients were examined. Each patient was fit with Acuvue, Cibasoft, and Biomedics contact lenses in random order. LogMar visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using the VectorVision CSV-1000 were measured.There was no significant difference in visual acuity between any contact lenses (P=.15). Contrast sensitivity at 12 cycles/degree was significantly lower for the Cibasoft lens compared to spectacles (P=.04). There was no significant difference between spectacles and contact lenses for remaining spatial frequencies (P=.07-.35).Visual acuity appears to be an insensitive method for evaluating soft contact lenses. The lathe-cut manufacturing process may be responsible for reduced visual function compared to cast-molded lenses. Further study in this area is needed.",1999-01-01,Brian S. Boxer Wachler,C L Phillips,Doheny Eye Institute,US,yes,"Yes.

manufacturing,Calibrated Oxygen Permeability of 35 Conventional Hydrogel Materials and Correlation with Water Content,"Purpose. The relationship between oxygen permeability (Dk) and water content of conventional hydrogel materials was reviewed using upgraded methods to measure both parameters in a masked fashion. This is the first report of conventional hydrogel Dk values that were calibrated using a set of reference materials and determined in the general format of ANSI Z80.20:1998 and ISO 9913- 1:1996. Methods. Calibrated, corrected polarographic Dk values were determined at 35°C for 35 conventional hydrogel materials available as contact lenses, obtained commercially. The refractive index was measured with an Abbe-type refractometer at room temperature and converted to water content by gravimetric adjustment of a volumetric equation derived from the Gladstone-Dale relationship. Results. Percentages of the water content of the materials determined by gravimetric adjustment (GAWC%) ranged from 33.8% to 70.7% and were strongly correlated with the gravimetric water contents stated by their manufacturers (SWC%). The linear regression was GAWC% = 1.004(SWC%)−2.403, with coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.929. R2 values of the corrected oxygen resistance (t/Dk) versus thickness (t) plots for the 35 materials were 0.96 or greater. Calibrated, corrected Dk values ranged from 8.4 to 44.8 Dk units and were strongly correlated with water content in a semilogarithmic manner. The linear regression was Log(Dk) = 0.01754 (GAWC%) + 0.3897, with R2 = 0.945 over the ranges of water content and Dk noted above. Conclusions. Water content determined by gravimetric adjustment of the known volumetric relationship was slightly more than 2% less, on average, than that stated by contact lens manufacturers. This was likely the result of the greater tonicity of the storage solution in this study or more pronounced blotting prior to measurement, or both; yet the soft lenses and blotting method were the same as used for Dk assessment. Commercially available soft lenses were consistently manufactured, the blotting method was sufficient, and the polarographic Dk methodogy was reliable such that linear resistance (t/Dk) versus thickness (t) plots resulted from lenses of different lots made of material having the same name. The semilogarithmic relationship of Dk and water content survived correction for boundary layers, correction for the edge effect, and calibration. Logically, the next step would be to refine this relationship even further by determining water content at the same temperature as oxygen permeability, 35°C.",2003-04-01,Matthew D. Young,William J. Benjamin,American Optometric Association,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it provides calibrated data on oxygen permeability (Dk) of conventional hydrogel materials used in soft contact lenses, which is crucial for understanding their performance and quality in manufacturing.

manufacturing,Clinical performance and factors affecting the physical fit of a soft toric frequent replacement contact lens,"Differences in ocular parameters between Chinese and Caucasian eyes may lead to differences in the success rate of soft contact lens fittings. As most disposable or frequent replacement lenses are manufactured based on data of Caucasian eyes, the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical performance and factors affecting the preliminary fitting of a 'one-fit' bi-weekly replacement soft toric lens on Hong Kong (HK)-Chinese.Forty-one HK-Chinese were fitted with Acuvue soft toric lenses (on one eye only). The success rate, the comfort, vision and the effects of central corneal curvature, horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID) and palpebral aperture size (PAS) on the physical fit of the toric lenses were determined.Twenty-four of 41 eyes (58.6 per cent) attained acceptable fit and satisfactory vision with these lenses. The main reason for unsuccessful lens fit was loose fitting. Only central corneal curvatures were significantly correlated (statistically) to the looseness of the lens.The results showed that about 40 per cent of our subjects were unable to obtain acceptable fit with this one-fit frequent replacement lens, the main reason for which was loose fit. This was expected due to the steeper corneas of the Chinese eyes and we would expect similar results with other one-fit soft lenses. Only the central corneal radii were significantly correlated with the looseness of the lens fit. However, this factor was not the main factor affecting the contact lens fitting. HVID and PAS did not appear to play any significant role in the physical fit of this lens. As there are individual variations of lens fitting behaviour, trial lens fitting assessment is the most suitable way to select the appropriate lens.",2002-11-01,Miu Kit Wong Bschons Optom,Tsui Tsui Lee Bschons Optom,Hong Kong Polytechnic University,HK,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Near‐Field Communication Powered Hydrogel‐Based Smart Contact Lens,"Abstract Nowadays, smart contact lenses (SCLs) display interesting features for healthcare monitoring; however, their comfort and practical usability strongly depend on the outermost material in contact with the eye. In this publication, the embedding of a custom‐made and thermoformed Near‐Field Communication based circuit in a conventional soft CL is presented. The circuit is composed of gold tracks on polyimide between thermoplastic polyurethane layers (insert), while the lens is based on industry standard double‐molding process of poly(2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with proven compatibility with corneal tissue. The lens shows stable geometrical parameters (bevel landing area) thus enabling a practical implementation. Finite element method models are used to optimize the thermoforming process in order to provide a stable and desired curvature of the insert before the embedding process. While the insert is designed to allow oxygen transmission at the center of the lens, a custom‐made ultra‐compact radio‐frequency antenna provides communication and wireless power transfer both in air and inside saline solutions. The successful combination of the intrinsic soft mechanical properties of the wirelessly powered electronic insert with conventional hydrogel materials and manufacturing processes delivers a practical solution for SCLs.

manufacturing,Quantifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa Adhesion to Contact Lenses1,"Purpose. Pseudomonal keratitis can occur in soft contact lens wearers following compromise of the corneal epithelium and exposure to pathogens. This study was initiated to determine if Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to adhere preferentially to unused contact lenses made from different FDA group polymers. Methods. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain PA01) was grown to its early stationary phase and diluted into phosphate-buffered saline to a concentration of 12,000 to 16,000 cells/mL. Samples from each of the four FDA-designated polymer classes used for the manufacture of soft lenses were incubated in pseudomonal inoculant for 4 hours. The lenses were removed and the number of bacteria bound was quantified using electrical impedance particle counting. Results. A lens constructed from a group I polymer (nonionic polymer with <50% water) bound the fewest bacteria (7.2% of total cells ± 1.0 SD) whereas a lens made from group II polymers (nonionic polymer with >50% water) showed the highest level of bacterial binding (42% of total cells ± 4.5 SD). Lenses constructed from group III and IV polymers showed intermediate levels of bacterial binding (28.4% ± 1.8 SD and 29.3% ± 1.7 SD, respectively). Conclusions. The polymer type used to construct the contact lens may influence subsequent bacterial adhesion events. Contact lenses made from nonionic polymers with high water content may carry higher risks of bacterial contamination.",2003-04-01,Yen N. T. Dang,Aravinda S. Rao,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Optical Assessment of Soft Contact Lens Edge-Thickness,"ABSTRACT Purpose To assess the edge shape of soft contact lenses using Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GD-OCM) with a 2-μm imaging resolution in three dimensions and to generate edge-thickness profiles at different distances from the edge tip of soft contact lenses. Methods A high-speed custom-designed GD-OCM system was used to produce 3D images of the edge of an experimental soft contact lens (Bausch + Lomb, Rochester, NY) in four different configurations: in air, submerged into water, submerged into saline with contrast agent, and placed onto the cornea of a porcine eyeball. An algorithm to compute the edge-thickness was developed and applied to cross-sectional images. The proposed algorithm includes the accurate detection of the interfaces between the lens and the environment, and the correction of the refraction error. Results The sharply defined edge tip of a soft contact lens was visualized in 3D. Results showed precise thickness measurement of the contact lens edge profile. Fifty cross-sectional image frames for each configuration were used to test the robustness of the algorithm in evaluating the edge-thickness at any distance from the edge tip. The precision of the measurements was less than 0.2 μm. Conclusions The results confirmed the ability of GD-OCM to provide high-definition images of soft contact lens edges. As a nondestructive, precise, and fast metrology tool for soft contact lens measurement, the integration of GD-OCM in the design and manufacturing of contact lenses will be beneficial for further improvement in edge design and quality control. In the clinical perspective, the in vivo evaluation of the lens fitted onto the cornea will advance our understanding of how the edge interacts with the ocular surface. The latter will provide insights into the impact of long-term use of contact lenses on the visual performance.",2016-05-27,Patrice Tankam,Jungeun Won,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Alternaria and Paecilomyces Keratitis Associated With Soft Contact Lens Wear,"To report a series of 5 patients with soft contact lens (SCL) related fungal keratitis caused by unusual organisms diagnosed at the Wills Eye Institute, Cornea Service in 2008.Chart review of patients with SCL related Alternaria and Paecilomyces keratitis diagnosed in 2008 was performed. Causes of these fungal infections were compared to previous years.During a period from 1999 to 2007, among 64 patients with fungal keratitis, Alternaria was isolated from one case after corneal foreign body removal in 2004, and Paecilomyces was not isolated in any of these patients. In 2008, however, 5 patients with SCL-related atypical fungal keratitis were diagnosed. Alternaria was isolated from 2 cases and Paecilomyces from 3 cases. All patients wore Acuvue SCL (Johnson & Johnson Vision Care): Acuvue Oasys, Acuvue Advance, and Acuvue 2 (1 case each) and Acuvue unspecified (2 cases). A total of 2 patients with Alternaria and 1 patient with Paecilomyces used ReNu or a generic-brand solution manufactured by Bausch & Lomb; 2 with Paecilomyces keratitis used Opti-free Replenish solution. A total of 3 patients wore lenses for daily wear and 2 wore them occasionally for overnight wear. The patients were treated with either voriconazole drops alone or combined with voriconazole 200 mg pills or Natamycin 5% drops. Three patients responded well to treatment. One patient with Paecilomyces keratitis developed a corneal perforation managed with tissue adhesive.

The probe has a vertical range of 15 μm with a resolution of 0.23 nm and a flat bandwidth response with a −3 dB cutoff at 228 Hz. Passing the output signal through a single pole 200 Hz low-pass filter, an overall system peak-to-peak broadband noise of less than 5 nm is observed. Manufactured primarily from inexpensive materials, the instrument demonstrates a stability of around 1 nm min−1 under controlled laboratory conditions. Using an inexpensive motor/gearbox/micrometer open-loop drive with velocity variations of up to 20%, profiles showing nanometer repeatability over 15 mm traces are demonstrated.

manufacturing,Controlled induction of spherical aberration with custom soft contact lenses,"This study investigated the non-invasive induction of spherical aberration (SA) levels consistent with complication-free wavefront-guided (WFG) refractive surgery using custom WFG soft contact lenses and quantified the resulting impact on visual performance.Twelve healthy individuals of typical military age (mean of 26.08 +/- 1.92 years) meeting the inclusion criteria of emmetropia (less than +/- 0.50 DS and less than +/- 0.50 DC) as measured by subjective refraction served as subjects. Five plano lenses were manufactured to induce a range of SA typical of those encountered after refractive surgery. The measured SA values over a 6 mm artificial pupil in these five lenses were -0.224 microm, 0.074 microm, 0.214 microm, 0.495 microm and 0.621 microm. For each subject, the level of total ocular aberrations through 10 Zernike radial orders over a 6 mm pupil was measured with a custom Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, while wearing each lens. Visual performance was evaluated using high contrast visual acuity (HCVA) measured through a 6 mm artificial pupil.Custom WFG soft contact lenses can be manufactured to include the range of SA that occurs with complication-free refractive surgery (-0.20 microm to +0.60 microm) and produces a change in SA within a similar range when worn on the eye. High contrast visual performance with these lenses varied, depending on the amount of SA in each lens. Visual performance worsened with greater amounts of positive or negative SA and a quadratic fit to the data peaked at +0.209 microm.Defined levels of SA can be manufactured and induced (non-invasively) with WFG soft contact lenses and their effect on logMAR high contrast visual performance can be measured. Results show that subjects' best logMAR HCVA occurs with the presence of positive residual SA. When designing the actual test lens, the targeted change in aberrations for each subject will likely be better achieved by first measuring the aberrations of a template lens on the eye and then compensating for unique subject dependent eye-lens interactions.",2009-04-01,Katrina E.

Purpose: To understand the pattern of prescribing contact lenses in Korea from 2010 to 2013. Methods: Four hundred survey questionnaires were randomly posted to Korean Optometric clinics for 4 years. The questionnaire was the same form as a form used for International Contact Lens Prescribing Trend. It was also designed to collect information about the contact lenses prescribed to the first 10 patients after its receipt. Results: 1937 fits were used for the analysis among the four hundred survey questionnaires.

mold,A Biphasic Model for Micro-Indentation of a Hydrogel-Based Contact Lens,"The stiffness and hydraulic permeability of soft contact lenses may influence its clinical performance, e.g., on-eye movement, fitting, and wettability, and may be related to the occurrence of complications; e.g., lesions. It is therefore important to determine these properties in the design of comfortable contact lenses. Micro-indentation provides a nondestructive means of measuring mechanical properties of soft, hydrated contact lenses. However, certain geometrical and material considerations must be taken into account when analyzing output force-displacement (F-D) data. Rather than solely having a solid response, mechanical behavior of hydrogel contact lenses can be described as the coupled interaction between fluid transport through pores and solid matrix deformation. In addition, indentation of thin membranes ( approximately 100 microm) requires special consideration of boundary conditions at lens surfaces and at the indenter contact region. In this study, a biphasic finite element model was developed to simulate the micro-indentation of a hydrogel contact lens. The model accounts for a curved, thin hydrogel membrane supported on an impermeable mold. A time-varying boundary condition was implemented to model the contact interface between the impermeable spherical indenter and the lens. Parametric studies varying the indentation velocities and hydraulic permeability show F-D curves have a sensitive region outside of which the force response reaches asymptotic limits governed by either the solid matrix (slow indentation velocity, large permeability) or the fluid transport (high indentation velocity, low permeability). Using these results, biphasic properties (Young's modulus and hydraulic permeability) were estimated by fitting model results to F-D curves obtained at multiple indentation velocities (1.2 and 20 microm/s). Fitting to micro-indentation tests of Etafilcon A resulted in an estimated permeability range of 1.0 x 10(-15) to 5.0 x 10(-15) m(4)N s and Young's modulus range of 130 to 170 kPa.",2006-09-13,Xiaoming Chen,Alison C.

mold,Controlled release of prednisolone acetate from molecularly imprinted hydrogel contact lenses,"Abstract The aim of this work was to study the influence of methacrylic acid (MAA) as a comonomer and the application of a molecular imprinting technique on the loading and release properties of weakly crosslinked 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) hydrogels, with a view toward their use as reloadable soft contact lenses for the administration of prednisolone acetate (PA). The hydrogels were prepared with HEMA (95.90–98.30 mol %) as a backbone monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (140 m M ) as a crosslinker, and MAA (0, 50, 100, or 200 m M ) as a functional monomer. Different PA/MAA molar ratios (0, 1 : 8, 1 : 6, and 1 : 4) in the feed composition of the hydrogels were also applied to study the influence of the molecular imprinting technique on their binding properties. The hydrogels (0.4 mm thick) were synthesized by thermal polymerization at 60°C for 24 h in a polypropylene mold. The hydrogels were then characterized by the determination of their swelling and binding properties in water. Their loading and release properties were also studied in 0.9% NaCl and artificial lachrymal fluid. Increasing the MAA content of the hydrogel and applying the molecular imprinting technique led to an increase in the loading capacity of the hydrogel. The optimized imprinted hydrogel showed the highest affinity for PA and the greatest ability to control the release process, sustaining it for 48 h. The results obtained clearly indicate that the incorporation of MAA as a comonomer increased the PA loading capacity of hydrogel. Our data showed that the molecular imprinting technique also had a significant effect on the loading and release properties of the hydrogels. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

mold,A concept for bifocal contact‐ or intraocular lenses: liquid single crystal hydrogels (“LSCH”),"Abstract The synthesis of liquid single crystal hydrogels (“LSCH”) in suitable molds offers an innovative concept to realize bifocal contact‐ or intraocular‐lenses. LSCH combine the properties required for applications as bifocal ophthalmic lenses: the soft and water‐containing hydrogel enables oxygen permeation and exhibits high birefringence due to the liquid crystalline phase structure built up by rigid rod‐like amphiphiles. Via a photo‐initiated crosslinking reaction of aqueous solutions of monomeric lyotropic liquid crystalline amphiphiles in the macroscopically ordered liquid crystalline state, we obtain optically uniaxially ordered and transparent LSCH. The orientation process and the phase structure of the anisotropic hydrogel is analyzed by deuterium NMR‐spectroscopy.

mold,Broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of a new multi-purpose disinfecting solution.,"There has been increasing awareness of the need for more powerful contact lens disinfectants, ideally having low toxicity and allergenicity to ocular tissue. Opti-Free Express with ALDOX Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution (MPDS) was recently marketed as a new multi-purpose disinfecting solution for soft contact lenses. MPDS contains two antimicrobial agents, polyquaternium-1 and myristamidopropyl dimethylamine, to broaden the range of antimicrobial activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of MPDS against microorganisms that have been reported as contact lens and lens case contaminants and causative agents of microbial keratitis.MPDS was challenged with high numbers of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, mold, and Acanthamoeba. Several lots of product were challenged with at least three separate inocula of each isolate. After exposure to the disinfecting solution, a sample was removed from the product and plated for survivors by suitable recovery methods. The plates were incubated and the number of survivors was enumerated.The results showed that MPDS was bactericidal, fungicidal and amoebicidal against an extensive variety of environmental contaminants of lens care accessories and ocular pathogens. MPDS was capable of killing a broad spectrum of microorganisms. The log reduction exceeded the primary criteria for disinfecting products and produced a notable reduction of other clinical and environmental isolates as well.Opti-Free Express MPDS contains antimicrobial agents that can kill an extensive spectrum of many different types of microorganisms that may contaminate contact lenses and solutions.",2000-07-01,R A Rosenthal,C L McAnally,Alcon (United States),US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,Ideal tetrafunctional amphiphilic PEG/PDMS conetworks by a dual‐purpose extender/crosslinker. II. Characterization and properties of water‐swollen membranes,"Abstract Select characteristics and properties of a series of ideal tetrafunctional amphiphilic conetworks consisting of random poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments crosslinked by a novel dual‐purpose crosslinker/extender were determined. The overall composition of the conetworks was varied in the 16–40% PEG range, and membranes were prepared by polymerizing/crosslinking charges in molds. Membranes were characterized by equilibrium swelling (both in water and n ‐heptane) and by determining their oxygen permeabilities and select mechanical properties. Swelling in water increases, whereas in heptane it decreases with increasing PEG content. Significant swelling in both solvents indicates bicontinuous (bipercolating) PEG and PDMS phases. Bicontinuity is reached with ∼13% PEG in the conetworks. The oxygen permeabilities of optically clear water‐swollen membranes containing 24, 32, and 40 wt % PEG are ∼350, ∼245 and ∼185 barrers, respectively, i.e. , oxygen permeability decreases by increasing the hydrophilic constituent. These oxygen permeabilities are far superior to those of contemporary soft contact lenses. The tensile strengths and moduli of water‐swollen membranes decrease, while elongations increase, with increasing PEG content. Dry membranes exhibit first order transitions at −52 and ∼46 °C indicating phase‐separated crystalline PDMS and PEG domains, respectively. Both dry and water‐swollen membranes are optically clear, indicating the presence of PEG and PDMS domains with dimensions well below the wavelength of visible light. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Moldex3D R13.0 is used to simulate and analyze the shrinkage of the front contact lens curve on the front shell mold in Z-axis direction. First, the design of experiment (DOE) method is applied to obtain the optimal setting parameters (melt temperature, injection velocity, and packing pressure). Amount of the shrinkage error is used to compensate the original design curve to improve the shrinkage error in the next simulations. The simulation result after compensation shows that the shrinkage error is reduced as 80.8%. The adding value to compensate the original design curve should be optimized to minimize shrinkage error. Result of this study can effectively improve the shrinkage error before fabricating the shell molds of the soft aspheric contact lens.",2017-01-01,Chao‐Chang A.

mold,Microbial contamination of hydrophilic contact lenses. Part I: Quantitation of microbes on patient worn-and-handled lenses.,"We cultured Soflens (polymacon) contact lenses to determine the number of microorganisms present following normal patient wear and handling just prior to disinfection. Total protein deposited was determined for the companion lens from each patient. A random population of 109 adapted soft contact lens patients participated in the study. Some patients participated more than once, resulting in a total of 196 lenses being cultured and 195 lenses analyzed for total protein. The left lens was cultured immediately. The right lens was extracted at 70 degrees C in sodium hydroxide, and the total protein in the extract determined using a modified Lowry protein assay. The mean protein deposition per lens was 3.4 micrograms (median 2 micrograms per lens; range less than 1 to 78 micrograms/lens). Microorganisms were cultured from 95% of the lenses. The mean bacterial count (in colony forming units per lens) was 2,482 (median: 123; range less than 3 to 150,000). Fungal contamination was found on 11% of the lenses at very low levels (3-9 yeast/lens and 3-18 mold/lens).

mold,An Unusual Case of Fungal Keratitis,"Purpose. To report a case of fungal keratitis caused by Metarrhizium anisopliae, which to our knowledge is the first reported case in the United States. Method. Case report. Results. A 36-year-old female librarian who wore extended-wear soft contact lenses was seen by an ophthalmologist on September 11 for an irritated right eye, and a corneal ulcer was diagnosed. Symptoms increased by September 27, and the patient was referred to another ophthalmologist who cultured the ulcer and had scrapings examined, which were Gram-negative for microorganisms. The patient was referred to one of the authors (W.J.R.). Her exam on October 1 showed vision corrected to 20/25 OD, a 5-mm epithelial defect with a 2.5-mm anterior stromal grayish-type infiltrate, and a quiet anterior chamber; the eye did not appear to be inflamed. The patient was reexamined on October 4 and was noted to have worsening vision. Because the initial cultures remained negative, the patient underwent a corneal biopsy, Gram stain, and cultures on October 6. Scrapings at the time of the biopsy revealed septate hyphal elements, as did the biopsy specimen, and on October 7, the patient was started on a treatment of bacitracin ointment once a day and natamycin 5% every hour. The eye gradually quieted down. A mold growing from the biopsy culture, which had been sent to a reference laboratory in San Antonio, Texas, was identified as M. anisopliae var. anisopliae. The patient was subsequently fitted with a rigid gas permeable lens, which resulted in a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20, although glare remained a major problem. Conclusion. Although not previously reported in the United States, M. anisopliae can cause a keratomycosis, and one must consider this common insect pathogen in the differential diagnosis of fungal keratitis.",2001-10-01,Binoy R.

mold,Moldable Crystalline α-Chitin Hydrogel with Toughness and Transparency toward Ocular Applications,"A N-acetylated chitosan hydrogel was investigated for ocular applications. One of the drawbacks in the original hydrogel protocol, poor moldability, was circumvented by optimizing the addition of the acetylating agent, acetic acid anhydride (Ac2O), at −10 °C. This simple but significant optimization realized the preparation of N-acetylated chitosan hydrogels with a wider variety of parameters such as higher chitosan concentration and molecular weight, the use of a more benign solvent (ethanol replaced methanol), and the arbitral shapes ranging from microbeads and contact lenses to bulky blocks that could be gripped. The prepared N-acetylated chitosan hydrogels exhibited high transparency and integrity given the nanofibrous network made of highly crystalline α-chitin. Furthermore, the gel retained a regenerable character: an oven-dried gel was reswollen by emersion in an acid bath. These previously unnoticed advantages and the innate high biocompatibility of chitosan and chitin elevate N-acetylated chitosan hydrogel as a next-generation bio-derived soft material for ocular applications such as contact lenses, artificial corneas, and drug delivery vehicles.",2020-03-17,Noriyuki Isobe,Mikiko Tsudome,Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,Shrinkage Analysis on Convex Shellby Injection Molding,"Abstract Injection molding of a convex shell has induced divergent flow front directions and therefore the shrinkage of a convex shell is difficult to controll. In some optical applications, such as ophthalmic devices of soft contact lens, that can be cast molded with a set of two convex shells made by injection molding there is a demand in maintaining dimensional stability. This research investigates the optimization of injection molding parameters for the minimum shrinkage of a convex shell of polypropylene (PP). The MPI 5.0 software is used first to simulate the filling stage of the convex shell and find the feasible operational ranges of parameters. Experiments were performed by an electric injection machine. Short shot experiments have been tested to compare with results of mold flow simulation. Taguchi's method is then used to find the optimal parameters for the minimum shrinkage of convex shell. Four parameters or factors, including mold temperature, injection temperature, holding pressure, and cooling time are considered in this study. An ANOVA table has been obtained for checking the significance of parameters. Results of simulation and experiments have been compared and the holding or packing pressure is found as the most significant parameter for the minimum shrinkage of a convex shell. Cooling time and injection temperature have been found as the second and third most significant parameters in this study. The optimal parameters have been established and then verified by the optimal injection molding experiment and the minimum shrinkage of convex shell was obtained as 72 μm.",2008-02-25,C.-C. A.

mold,Effect of softperm lens wear on corneal thickness and topography: a comparison between keratoconic and normal corneae.,"Complications related to contact lens-induced anoxia in the keratoconic eye are well documented, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study compared topographical changes in corneal thickness and anterior corneal radius following SoftPerm (Ciba Vision, Atlanta, GA) (rigid-and-soft combination) lens wear in a group of keratoconic and normal individuals.Video keratoscopic (VKS) (EyeSys, Houston, TX) and ultrasonographic pachometry measurements were taken at nine ocular locations, at central, mid-peripheral, and peripheral corneal areas of keratoconic and normal subjects. Subjects were subsequently fitted with SoftPerm lenses and further measurements of corneal topography and thickness were noted after 1 day, 2 weeks, and 1 month of daily wear.Corneal thickness increased significantly in normal and keratoconic eyes following SoftPerm lens wear. Radius values obtained from the VKS measurements indicated that a significant and progressive degree of corneal flattening occurred for the keratoconic subjects at the 1-day, 2-week, and 1-month intervals, in contrast to the normal group, whose corneal radii remained unchanged.Corneal swelling occurs in both normal and keratoconic corneas following SoftPerm lens wear.

In optics, metasurfaces, an array of sub-wavelength nanostructures, have offered optical multifunctionality in an ultra-compact form factor, facilitating integration into various imaging, and display systems. However, transferring metasurfaces onto contact lenses remains challenging due to the non-biocompatible materials of extant imprinting methods and the structural instability caused by the swelling and shrinking of the wetted surface. Here, a biocompatible method is presented to transfer metasurfaces onto contact lenses using hyaluronic acid (HA) as a soft mold and to allow for holographic light projection. A high-efficiency metahologram is obtained with an all-metallic 3D meta-atom enhanced by the anisotropy of a rectangular structure, and a reflective background metal layer.

mold,Results From the German Fungal Keratitis Registry: Significant Differences Between Cases With and Without a History of Contact Lens Use,"Purpose: Fungal keratitis (FK) is a serious ophthalmic disease with a potentially devastating outcome that seems to be increasing in recent years. The use of contact lenses (CLs) was evaluated as a risk factor for FK to determine possible differences in course and outcome. Methods: Data from 173 cases reported in the German FK registry until August 2019 were evaluated regarding CL behavior, other ophthalmological and general risk factors, age, sex, identified pathogens, conservative and surgical therapy, visual acuity, and findings at admission and follow-up. Results: One hundred seventy-four eyes from 173 patients between 2000 and 2019 were included [64.4% women, median age 54 (39; 72) years]; 49.7% wore CL, of which 81.3% were soft CL, and 50.3% had no history of contact lens use (NCL). CL users were significantly more often women and otherwise healthy (CL: 80.2% vs. NCL: 48.9%; P &lt; 0.0001). The spectrum of pathogens among CL users showed a significantly higher proportion of infections with filamentous pathogens, in particular Fusarium sp. (total filament: CL 69.8% vs. NCL 27.3%; P = 0.0001; Fusarium sp.: CL 50.0% vs. NCL 14.8%; P &lt; 0.0001). Overall, 54.6% required keratoplasty and 8.6% enucleation. Conclusions: CLS are the most important risk factor for FK in Germany. With CLs, typically, the infection is caused by molds, and patients are comparably younger and otherwise healthy. Often, extensive surgery is needed. To evaluate changes in the pathogen and resistance spectrum and to further monitor possible CL-related risk factors, a consistent collection of data remains paramount.",2021-06-15,Mathias Roth,Christoph Holtmann,Düsseldorf University Hospital,DE,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

Methods: Case reports, with review of the relevant literature. Results: Two otherwise healthy middle-aged women who were soft contact lens wearers developed fungal keratitis about 1 week after heavy exposure to environmental mold. Culture results showed Aspergillus from one patient and the unusual combination of Trichoderma and Penicillium from the other. Both were treated with topical natamycin, topical fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis, and periodic ulcer debridement. After many weeks of treatment, both ulcers healed with subsequent scarring. Because the ulcers were located in the peripheral cornea in both cases, excellent final visual acuities were achieved. Fungal keratitis cases like these are rarely seen at our referral clinic, which is located in the temperate climate of northeastern Indiana.

mold,Compensating additional optical power in the central zone of a multifocal contact lens forminimization of the shrinkage error of the shell mold in the injection molding process,"This study aims to develop a compensating method to minimize the shrinkage error of the shell mold (SM) in the injection molding (IM) process to obtain uniform optical power in the central optical zone of soft axial symmetric multifocal contact lenses (CL). The Z-shrinkage error along the Z axis or axial axis of the anterior SM corresponding to the anterior surface of a dry contact lens in the IM process can be minimized by optimizing IM process parameters and then by compensating for additional (Add) powers in the central zone of the original lens design. First, the shrinkage error is minimized by optimizing three levels of four IM parameters, including mold temperature, injection velocity, packing pressure, and cooling time in 18 IM simulations based on an orthogonal array L18 (21×34). Then, based on the Z-shrinkage error from IM simulation, three new contact lens designs are obtained by increasing the Add power in the central zone of the original multifocal CL design to compensate for the optical power errors. Results obtained from IM process simulations and the optical simulations show that the new CL design with 0.1 D increasing in Add power has the closest shrinkage profile to the original anterior SM profile with percentage of reduction in absolute Z-shrinkage error of 55% and more uniform power in the central zone than in the other two cases. Moreover, actual experiments of IM of SM for casting soft multifocal CLs have been performed. The final product of wet CLs has been completed for the original design and the new design. Results of the optical performance have verified the improvement of the compensated design of CLs. The feasibility of this compensating method has been proven based on the measurement results of the produced soft multifocal CLs of the new design. Results of this study can be further applied to predict or compensate for the total optical power errors of the soft multifocal CLs.",2018-04-10,Vu Thi Lien,Chao‐Chang A.

The purpose of this morphologic study was to describe the deposits on soft contact lenses fabricated by different surface manufacturing methods and to evaluate the ease of removal of deposits by surfactant cleaning. We studied the anterior surfaces of 30 soft contact lenses (10 lathe cut [polished]; 10 spin cast [unpolished], and 10 cast molded [unpolished]) of the same polymer and water content. All lenses were worn for 8 hours by two asymptomatic persons who did not routinely wear contact lenses. Lenses from one eye were immersed in glutaraldehyde, while lenses from the other eye were cleaned before immersion in glutaraldehyde. All lenses were then dehydrated in graded alcohols, critical-point-dried, and observed by scanning electron microscopy. The amount of deposit on the lens surface was judged by an individual who did not know the identity of the lens. All lenses showed similar types of deposits. At the end of 8 hours wear, all types of lens surfaces were covered with deposits. Cleaning removed some but not all deposits. The lens surfaces manufactured in such a way as to leave polishing or lathe marks showed deposits ""heaped-up"" on the marks before cleaning and remaining in the mark after cleaning.

mold,The influence of PEGDA’s molecular weight on its mechanical properties in the context of biomedical applications,"Abstract Hydrogels are 3D polymeric networks, which exhibit properties such as softness, viscoelasticity and their ability to absorb large amounts of water. These characteristics make them exceptionally suitable in biomedicine as e.g. tissue scaffolds, drug delivery systems, wound dressings or contact lenses. One of these hydrogels is the biocompatible, hydrophilic and photopolymerizable poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). It is used in different biomedical applications due to its tunable mechanical characteristics. In our study, the mechanical properties of different PEGDA hydrogel compositions with variyng molecular masses and contents of water/methanol, were investigated. Different compositions containing 20 m%, 30 m% or 40 m% of PEGDA 4K (4,000 g/mol), PEGDA 10K (10,000 g/mol) or PEGDA 20K (20,000 g/mol) in ultrapure water/methanol (1:2) were produced. Dumbbell-shaped samples were prepared in molds via photopolymerization in a UV chamber. Lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) was used as photoinitiator (0.5% w/w). The mechanical testing was performed using a uniaxial testing system. The obtained results showed averagely 78% higher tensile strength (σmax) values for 30 m% and 40 m% samples in comparison with 20 m% samples for all of the tested polymers. PEGDA 20K 30 m% samples showed the highest σmax among all of the samples with 12.8 MPa. All of the PEGDA20K samples exhibited the highest elongation at break (εB) values (up to 958%), whereas the lowest values were found for PEGDA 4K (up to 105%). The obtained stress-strain curves for most of the samples were typical for deformable, amorphous polymers with a deformation upon reaching a critical stress point. The PEGDA materials showed variable mechanical characteristics according to changing molecular mass or polymer concentration.

The final materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Polyurea can assume many forms revealing its versatility in terms of produced shapes. In good agreement with FTIR, SAXS studies showed a microphase separated structure arising from inter‐hard‐domain spacings, which remains unchanged after incorporation of the drugs. DSC analysis demonstrated that the PEO chain mobility was poorly affected after the drugs incorporation due to the solvation of the drugs through the network. The water uptake and the amount of drug released agree well, playing an important role for controlled Nap and 5FU release. This work opens positive perspectives for ocular drug delivery and wound management, due to the easy processability of the xerogel, which has high feasibility to be moldable as pharmaceutical devices for contact lenses and transdermal patches purposes containing distinct therapeutic agents.",2021-11-26,Mariane A. de Resende,Gabriele A.

mold,Nanoimprint lithography: An old story in modern times? A review,"Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a high throughput, high-resolution parallel patterning method in which a surface pattern of a stamp is replicated into a material by mechanical contact and three dimensional material displacement. This can be done by shaping a liquid followed by a curing process for hardening, by variation of the thermomechanical properties of a film by heating and cooling, or by any other kind of shaping process using the difference in hardness of a mold and a moldable material. The local thickness contrast of the resulting thin molded film can be used as a means to pattern an underlying substrate on wafer level by standard pattern transfer methods, but also directly in applications where a bulk modified functional layer is needed. Therefore it is mainly aimed toward fields in which electron beam and high-end photolithography are costly and do not provide sufficient resolution at reasonable throughput. The aim of this review is to play between two poles: the need to establish standard processes and tools for research and industry, and the issues that make NIL a scientific endeavor. It is not the author’s intention to duplicate the content of the reviews already published, but to look on the NIL process as a whole. The author will also address some issues, which are not covered by the other reviews, e.g., the origin of NIL and the misconceptions, which sometimes dominate the debate about problems of NIL, and guide the reader to issues, which are often forgotten or overlooked.",2008-03-01,Helmut Schift,,Paul Scherrer Institute,CH,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

injection,The Vascular Response to Contact Lens Wear,"The ocular limbal blood vessels were studied in daily wearers of soft contact lenses and hard contact lenses, and in eyes of subjects who had never worn a contact lens. The degree of filling of vessels and the number of vessels crossing the limbus were measured photographically at the inferior limbus. The extent to which vessel filling in contact lens wearers could be considered as capillary injection, as apposed to new vessel growth, was estimated by comparing the degree of injection in lens wearers to that found in nonwearers given a vasodilating stimulus. It was found that soft lens wearers showed greater limbal injection than hard lens wearers. The limbal vasculature of hard lens wearers was indistinguishable from that of nonwearers. The vascular response to soft lens wear was similar in magnitude to that produced by vasodilating agents in noncontact lens wearers, and was therefore considered to be due to the filling of preexisting capilliaries rather than new vessel growth. The chronic level of vessel dilation in soft lens wearers is cause for concern, as sustained dilation of the limbal vessels may be a precursor to new vessel growth.",1982-10-01,Charles W. McMonnies,Anthony Chapman‐davies,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

injection,Applications of Hyaluronic Acid in Ophthalmology and Contact Lenses,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan that was first isolated and identified from the vitreous body of a bull’s eye. HA is ubiquitous in the soft connective tissues of animals and therefore has high tissue compatibility for use in medication. Because of HA’s biological safety and water retention properties, it has many ophthalmology-related applications, such as in intravitreal injection, dry eye treatment, and contact lenses. Due to its broad range of applications, the identification and quantification of HA is a critical topic. This review article discusses current methods for analyzing HA. Contact lenses have become a widely used medical device, with HA commonly used as an additive to their production material, surface coating, and multipurpose solution. HA molecules on contact lenses retain moisture and increase the wearer’s comfort. HA absorbed by contact lenses can also gradually release to the anterior segment of the eyes to treat dry eye. This review discusses applications of HA in ophthalmology.",2021-04-24,Wan-Hsin Chang,Peiyi Liu,Yung Shin Pharmaceutical Industrial (Taiwan),TW,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

injection,Microbial keratitis associated with extended wear of silicone hydrogel contact lenses,"Traditional hydrogel soft contact lenses (SCL) have limited oxygen permeability.1, 2 Recently introduced silicone hydrogel SCL have much higher oxygen transmissibility (Dk/t O2), allowing near normal oxygen supply to the cornea during extended lid closure, and are hoped by some to address most of the problems related to corneal hypoxia encountered with previous extended wear soft contact lenses.1, 3 They have therefore been approved for up to 30 days of continuous wear in both Europe and Australia.

Four cases of microbial keratitis in patients who were using silicone hydrogel SCL (either CibaVision Focus Night and Day lenses (Lotrafilicon A, fluorosiloxane hydrogel) or Bausch & Lomb PureVision lenses (Balafilcon A, silicone hydrogel)) on an extended wear basis are presented. The minimum amount of continuous wear was 24 hours. All cases were treated either in private or at the corneal clinic of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital from December 2000 to February 2001. All the patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination by a corneal specialist. Microbiological specimens were taken from all patients via cornea scrapings and were submitted for Gram and Blankophor staining, and bacterial and fungal cultures via direct inoculation onto sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and Sabouraud agar. Bacterial sensitivities of cultured organisms were also obtained. Where possible, the contact lenses themselves were also sent for microbial cultures.

Each case is described in brief, and a summary presented in Table 1.

injection,Patient Preferences and Comparative Ocular Responses to Rigid and Soft Contact Lenses,"Patient preferences and ocular responses were compared between rigid and soft contact lenses by randomly fitting 32 neophyte subjects with a rigid lens in 1 eye and a soft lens in the contralateral eye. Twentyseven of 32 subjects completed the 3-month study and 16 subjects were willing to continue for an additional 3-month extension. Subjects preferred the comfort and handling of the soft lens but preferred the vision provided by the rigid lens and initially its ease of maintenance. There was also a marked preference for the soft lens when all aspects of lens wear were compared. Objectively, the rigid lenses were responsible for more ocular changes than the soft lenses. Palpebral aperture sizes of the rigid gas permeable (RGP) wearing eyes decreased significantly (0.5 mm; p<0.05) compared to the soft lens wearing eyes. The incidence of corneal staining was significantly greater in the rigid lens wearing eye (50% RGP vs. 22% soft) but limbal injection was greater in the soft lens wearing eye (18% soft vs. 6% RGP). Refractive sphere, cylinder, and corneal astigmatism decreased in the rigid lens wearing eye after 3 months.

injection,Ocular Concentrations of Mitomycin C Using Different Delivery Devices,"Hypotony and its sequelae are a frequent complication of trabeculectomies performed with mitomycin C (MMC), possibly related to intraocular toxicity of the substance. In an animal model with rabbits, we used different devices for the application of MMC and measured extra- and intraocular concentrations by HPLC. In addition, the concentrations of MMC remaining in the devices were determined. The devices were (1) a regular surgical sponge, (2) a scleral shield, (3) a presoaked soft contact lens, (4) a soft contact lens with MMC application, and (5) subconjunctival injection. Ocular concentrations of MMC were similar within the first 4 groups and were highest in the last. The measurements suggest that MMC penetrates intraocularly regardless of the device used. The variability of remaining MMC concentrations in the devices was lowest in the soft contact lenses suggesting an improved delivery system compared to the usually used surgical sponges.",1997-12-04,Holger Mietz,Michael Diestelhorst,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

injection,Delayed tear clearance in contact lens associated papillary conjunctivitis,"To study the tear film clearance in contact lens associated papillary conjunctivitis patients.Fifty-eight daily-wear soft contact lens wearers completed a questionnaire regarding a survey of their contact lens usage and subjective symptoms. They were grouped according to the size of conjunctival papillae, namely PC1 with no papillae, PC2 with papillae of less than 0.3 mm, and PC3 with papillae of 0.3-1.0 mm in diameter. Tear film breakup time and fluorescein clearance tests were performed.There was a median of 1, 2, and 3 subjective symptoms in PC1, PC2, and PC3 groups respectively (p < 0.001). Patients with larger papillae on their upper tarsus had more subjective symptoms such as burning sensation, discharge, limbal injection, foreign body sensation and dryness sensation (p = 0.018, 0.001, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.036 respectively). They also had shorter tear film breakup time (p = 0.05), delayed tear clearance (p = 0.002) and more corneal neovascularization (p < 0.001). Patients having delayed tear clearance test tended to have more subjective symptoms (p = 0.004) and larger papillae on upper tarsus (p = 0.002). However, neither the way the patients cleaned their contact lenses nor their enzyme cleaning frequency associated with the tear fluorescein clearance (p = 0.528 and 0.394, respectively). Meibomian gland dysfunction and corneal neovascularization did not correlate with the delayed tear clearance either (p = 0.111 and 0.717, respectively).Tear clearance in contact lens associated papillary conjunctivitis patients was delayed. We proposed that delayed tear clearance might increase the protein and inflammatory mediator concentrations in the tear film and contribute to the pathogenesis or aggravate the severity of contact lens associated papillary conjunctivitis.",2001-01-01,Shu-Wen Chang,Chee‐Jen Chang,Chang Gung University,TW,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

Contact lens-associated giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) was studied as a model for the anti-inflammatory effect of LE. Patients with bilateral GPC were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel group comparison of loteprednol etabonate 0.5% ophthalmic suspension and the LE vehicle (placebo). Patients were instructed to instill 1 drop of the test medication into each eye 4 times daily for 4 weeks, and follow-up examinations occurred on Days 2 or 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of masked therapy. Of 113 patients enrolled, 110 patients (LE=55; placebo=55) completed the study as planned. Patients receiving LE demonstrated significant reduction in the primary ocular signs of GPC (papillae, p < 0.001) and were rated better in the Investigator's Global Assessment (p=0.017). LE did not elevate intraocular pressure during the study, and ratings for bulbar conjunctival injection and the Patient Opinion Assessment demonstrated statistical trends that favored treatment with LE.

injection,Successful Immunization Against Acanthamoeba Keratitis in a Pig Model,"The feasibility of inducing protective immunity to Acanthamoeba keratitis was tested in a pig model. Experiments were designed to determine if ocular infection with Acanthamoeba trophozoites would elicit protection against reinfection. Additional experiments examined whether injection of parasite antigens either intramuscularly, subconjunctivally, or by both routes would induce immunity. Therefore, four groups of animals were examined: (a) pigs that had resolved a primary corneal infection with Acanthamoeba; (b) pigs immunized intramuscularly; (c) pigs immunized subconjunctivally; and (d) pigs immunized intramuscularly and subconjunctivally. Animals were subsequently challenged with parasite-laden soft contact lenses and observed clinically for the appearance of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Acanthamoeba-specific serum antibody titers and blastogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined weekly. The results indicated that intramuscular injection of Acanthamoeba antigens failed to protect against ocular infection even though hosts developed high titers of IgG antibodies and displayed lymphocyte blastogenic responses to parasite antigens. Ocular infection alone failed to stimulate immunity in any of the animals. By contrast, 50% of the hosts immunized subconjunctivally were protected against corneal disease, and 100% of the animals immunized by a combination of intramuscular and subconjunctival administration of parasite antigens were completely protected against two separate ocular challenges with infectious parasites. Protection did not correlate with either IgG antibody titers or blastogenic potentials of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Interestingly, ocular infection alone failed to stimulate immunity to subsequent ocular challenge with infectious parasites. Thus, administration of parasite antigen via the subconjunctival route can protect against Acanthamoeba keratitis.",1995-03-01,Hassan Alizadeh,Yu-Guang He,The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

injection,Clinical Investigation of Asmofilcon A Silicone Hydrogel Lenses,"Purpose. To investigate the clinical and subjective performance of asmofilcon A, a new third generation silicone hydrogel contact lens during 6-night extended wear (EW) over 6 months. Methods. A prospective, randomized, single-masked study was conducted. Sixty experienced daily wear soft contact lens wearers were randomly assigned to wear either asmofilcon A or senofilcon A contact lenses bilaterally for 6 months on an EW basis. Evaluations were conducted at contact lens delivery and after 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months of EW. Results. Fifty subjects (83%) successfully completed the study. Two subjects experienced adverse events; one unilateral red eye with asmofilcon A and one asymptomatic infiltrate with senofilcon A. There were no significant differences in high or low contrast distance visual acuity between asmofilcon A and senofilcon A; however, low contrast distance visual acuity decreased significantly over time with both contact lens types (p < 0.05). The two lens types did not vary significantly with respect to any of the objective and subjective measures assessed (p > 0.05). Superior palpebral conjunctival injection showed a statistically significant increase over time with both lens types (p < 0.05). Both lens types were rated highly with respect to overall comfort, with subjects reporting 14 or 15 h of comfortable lens wearing time per day at each of the study visits (p > 0.05). Overall satisfaction ratings were also very high at all visits, with median scores of 95 (86 to 99) for asmofilcon A and 90 (85 to 96) for senofilcon A at 6 months (p > 0.05). Conclusions. Over 6 months of EW, the asmofilcon A contact lens performed in a similar manner to senofilcon A with respect to visual acuity, ocular health, and contact lens performance measures. Longer-term EW studies are required to investigate the changes over time observed with both lens types.",2009-04-01,Carol Lakkis,Stephen J.

injection,Nocardia asteroides sclerokeratitis in a contact lens wearer.,"To report a case of sclerokeratitis caused by Nocardia asteroides in a soft contact lens wearer.A 65-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of a corneal ulcer in the left eye. He wore two weekly disposable soft contact lenses on an extended basis. He revealed his history of gardening before the onset of symptoms. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. In the left eye, there was conjunctival injection. His cornea showed multiple patchy infiltrates, with a feathery border that was raised and involved up to the midstroma. There was a 3+ anterior chamber reaction. Corneal scrapings were performed for smears and cultures. Topical 2% amikacin sulfate every half hour along with oral clarithromycin therapy was initiated. On follow-up, the sclera lesions worsened.Smears of corneal scrapings revealed gram-positive filamentous bacteria in Gram's stain. The cultures grew Nocardia asteroides. The patient was switched to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim DS, Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) as the sclera was involved. The patient responded to treatment, and the infection resolved. When last seen, approximately 4 months after his initial presentation to us, his visual acuity was 20/40 in the affected eye. There was corneal scarring, and the adjacent sclera showed thinning.Nocardia sclerokeratitis can be associated with contact lens wear. Nocardia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a corneal ulcer with an indolent progressive course with feathery infiltrates. Topical amikacin and systemic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are effective drugs in the treatment of nocardial corneal infection with scleral involvement.",2002-04-01,M S Sridhar,Elisabeth J.

injection,Plasmin and Epidermal Growth Factor in the Tear Fluid of Contact-Lens Wearers: Effect of Wearing Different Types of Contact Lenses and Association with Clinical Findings,"The concentrations of plasmin and epidermal growth factor were determined in tear fluid (TF) samples from wearers of different types of contact lenses (CLs) during and after cessation of CL wear (CLW). TF samples of 50 healthy eyes served as controls. The plasmin concentrations in the control group (0.4 ± 0.1 μg/ml; mean ± SEM) were significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in the group of soft CL (SCL) wearers during CLW (1.2 ± 0.2 μg/ml). Cessation of CLW led to a decrease in TF plasmin concentrations from 1.2 ± 0.2 to 0.6 ± 0.1 μg/ml in the group of SCL wearers (p < 0.001), from 1.5 ± 1.1 to 0.3 ± 0.2 μg/ml in the group of extended-wear SCL wearers (p > 0.05) and from 0.4 ± 0.3 to 0.0 ± 0.0 μg/ml in the group of gas-permeable CL wearers (p > 0.05). After CLW cessation, TF plasmin levels of CL wearers did not differ from those of controls. The occurrence of plasmin in TF was associated with a higher degree of corneal neovascularization and with the presence of limbal injection.

injection,Corneal scarring associated with daily soft contact lens wear.,"Three young people developed scarring of the corneas in both eyes with loss of visual acuity while wearing cosmetic daily wear soft contact lenses. The condition was bilateral in all cases. The scarring began superiorly, spreading inferiorly, and was associated with signs of external inflammation, that is, conjunctival injection and corneal staining, when the patient first presented. The conjunctival injection resolved quickly on cessation of lens wear. However, the corneal staining and scarring were much slower to resolve. Two cases did eventually resolve completely. However, the other case was left with a permanent decrease in visual acuity, associated with a fairly marked induced astigmatism, secondary to the corneal changes. Possible etiologies of this condition are discussed, including allergies to chemicals and lens deposits or a hypoxic phenomenon. Induced astigmatism, secondary to soft contact lens wear, has previously been documented, apparently related to prolonged wearing time. These cases may be demonstrating the same phenomenon developed to a more advanced and serious stage.",1983-09-01,S T Conway,S Wagdi,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses corneal scarring associated with daily soft contact lens wear, which directly relates to the company's focus on soft contact lenses.

A 17-year-old male, highly myopic, prolonged soft contact lens wearer, presented to us with painless red watery right eye having remarkably diminished vision. Last six weeks he was treated elsewhere for the microbial keratitis with no improvement. No pain was reported and on the direct questionnaire about it he denied it. There was marked mixed conjunctival and ciliary injection. A central stromal opacity with a pronounced surrounding corneal ring of inflammatory infiltration and epithelial defect was seen on biomicroscopy of the right eye. Circular pannus was already formed reaching epithelial defect overlying corneal ring infiltrate. Acanthamoeba spp in the corneal sample was confirmed. Prolonged therapy with 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate solution combined with 0.1% hexamidine solution resulted in corneal healing left with a large central dense stromal opacity with circular pannus reaching peripheral third of the cornea but with very thin blood vessels and the best corrected visual acuity of 0.1 tested on Snellen chart.

injection,Superior fornix mass with retained soft contact lens,"A 35-year-old female presented to the oculoplastics clinic for a 1-month history of left upper eyelid painful mass, ptosis, and superior conjunctivitis with discharge [Figure 1a]. A palpable, pyogenic-like mass was present in the deep superior fornix. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a 1.2 cm well-circumscribed lesion superficially in the upper eyelid [Figure 1b]. Intraoperatively, double eversion of the eyelid and dissection into the mass revealed a large pocket granuloma with a retained soft contact lens [Figure 1c].Figure 1: A case of a retained contact lens causing foreign body granuloma. (a) External photograph demonstrating left eyelid fullness, ptosis, and conjunctival injection. (b) Computed tomography sagittal cut demonstrating a well-circumscribed, centrally low-density cystic lesion (yellow arrow) in the anterosuperior margin of the left globe. (c) Intraoperative photograph demonstrating everted superior eyelid with a deep forniceal defect containing a foreign body granuloma and removal of soft contact lensDiscussion Forniceal pyogenic granulomas involving contact lenses are usually a result of rigid gas permeable lenses, and generally cause chronic conjunctivitis and eye irritation.[1] Less commonly, retained soft contact lenses have been reported to masquerade as a superior orbital mass.[2] In these cases, double eversion of the eyelid generally reveals a visible contact lens in the deep superior fornix. In our case, double eversion revealed a deep forniceal defect with the contact lens surrounded by granulomatous tissue. Computed tomography imaging of masses with retained contact lens generally reveals a homogeneous cyst-like mass without evidence of a foreign body.[3] Some authors hypothesized that after a contact lens is displaced into the upper fornix, the contact lens can become fixed against the upper border of the tarsus.[4] With blinking, the contact lens erodes through the conjunctiva and can eventually be surrounded by granulation tissue.[5] Regardless of a history of a lost contact lens, the presence of a soft, mobile, purulent mass in the deep fornix of a contact lens wearer should raise suspicion for a foreign body granuloma from a retained contact lens. High clinical suspicion is key to establishing this relatively rare diagnosis given that some cases may present without conjunctival irritation or injection.[5] Surgical removal of the foreign body granuloma with a course of topical antibiotics can result in good clinical outcomes.

injection,Ocular Complications in Contact Lens Wear and the Risk Factors: A retrospective analysis,"Contact lens-related complications might range from harmless irritation to sight-threatening reactions. The key to prevention other than adhering to good hygiene is preliminary eye examinations and timely aftercare assessments. A retrospective analysis of 33 patient clinical records at the university clinic was performed to determine the ocular complications among soft contact lens wearers and its risk factors. Overall, findings indicate that conjunctival hyperemia was the most prevalent complication. Poor lens fit was associated with limbal injection and CLPC.

drug,Soft Contact Lenses as Drug Delivery Systems: A Review,"This review describes the role of contact lenses as an innovative drug delivery system in treating eye diseases. Current ophthalmic drug delivery systems are inadequate, particularly eye drops, which allow about 95% of the active substance to be lost through tear drainage. According to the literature, many interdisciplinary studies have been carried out on the ability of contact lenses to increase the penetration of topical therapeutic agents. Contact lenses limit drug loss by releasing the medicine into two layers of tears on either side of the contact lens, eventually extending the time of contact with the ocular surface. Thanks to weighted soft contact lenses, a continuous release of the drug over an extended period is possible. This article reviewed the various techniques to deliver medications through contact lenses, examining their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the potential of drug delivery systems based on contact lenses has been extensively studied.",2021-09-14,I.

drug,Development and Efficacy of a Drug-Releasing Soft Contact Lens,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the uptake and the release of antibiotics from a newly synthesized drug delivery hydrogel soft contact lens (SCL) using an ion ligand mechanism.The antibiotics used were Gatifloxacin (GFLX) and Moxifloxacin (MFLX). The uptake amount and the sustained-release kinetics of antibiotics were investigated in vitro, and were also compared with newly synthesized SCLs, etafilcon A and polymacon. The antibiotic concentrations in the cornea, aqueous humor, and crystalline lens, and the effect against bacterial proliferation were investigated in vivo using rabbit subjects. Additionally the drug release efficacy of the new SCL was compared with that of eye drop administrations.In vitro, antibiotic uptake was increased with the weight percent (wt%) of the anionic group, and the released amount of antibiotics was highest during the initial 1 hour period, which then decreased over the next 72 hours. The released antibiotics volume of the new SCLs was significantly higher throughout 72 hours than that of the other two materials, etafilcon A and polymacon (P < 0.01). Whereas in vivo, the concentrations found in the cornea and aqueous humor were higher than those for the eye drop groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Antibiotic release at those sites decreased over 72 hours. No bacterial populations were detectable in the group treated with the new SCL presoaked in antibiotics throughout the experimental periods.The new SCLs released the antibiotics over several days, and showed improved penetration into the eye, along with prevention of bacterial proliferation.",2013-03-05,Koji Kakisu,Toru Matsunaga,Toho University,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Advances in chemistry and composition of soft materials for drug releasing contact lenses,"Ocular drug delivery has always been a challenging feat to achieve in the field of medical sciences. One of the existing methods of non-invasive ocular drug delivery is the use of eye drops. However, drugs administered through these formulations have low bioavailability in the ocular system. This limitation can been overcome by using contact lenses as drug delivery vehicles. According to USA FDA definitions they can be categorized into two main categories-hard and soft contact lenses. Based on the material properties, hard contact lenses are mostly produced from polymers of acrylate monomers such as MMA (methyl methacrylate). These have the least water retention capacity, thereby, having minimal ability to diffuse oxygen into the corneal layer and are not ideal for long term use. Soft material contact lenses are flexible and are mainly hydrogel based. They have higher water retention capacities as compared to rigid contact lenses, which gives them the ability to transmit oxygen to the corneal layer. These hydrogel based soft materials are mainly produced from polymers of acrylate monomers such as HEMA (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and found to be better for drug delivery contact lenses. These polymer-based soft materials have been efficiently modified in terms of their chemistry to achieve diverse physicochemical properties to produce efficient ocular drug delivery systems. However, complications such as drug leaching during storage and distribution, sterilisation, preservation of integrity of the lens and the possibility of surface roughness due to the incorporated drug molecules still need to be optimised. This review highlights the chemistries of various polymeric molecules through which physicochemical properties can be modified to achieve optimum drug loading and sustained release of the drug for application in the ocular system.",2020-01-01,Subir Chatterjee,Prashant Upadhyay,Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,IN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Development of ocular drug delivery systems using molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses,"Recently, significant advances have been made in order to optimize drug delivery to ocular tissues. The main problems in ocular drug delivery are poor bioavailability and uncontrollable drug delivery of conventional ophthalmic preparations (e.g. eye drops). Hydrogels have been investigated since 1965 as new ocular drug delivery systems. Increase of hydrogel loading capacity, optimization of drug residence time on the ocular surface and biocompatibility with the eye tissue has been the main focus of previous studies. Molecular imprinting technology provided the opportunity to fulfill the above-mentioned objectives. Molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses (SCLs) have high potentials as novel drug delivery systems for the treatment of eye disorders. This technique is used for the preparation of polymers with specific binding sites for a template molecule. Previous studies indicated that molecular imprinting technology could be successfully applied for the preparation of SCLs as ocular drug delivery systems. Previous research, particularly in vivo studies, demonstrated that molecular imprinting is a versatile and effective method in optimizing the drug release behavior and enhancing the loading capacity of SCLs as new ocular drug delivery systems. This review highlights various potentials of molecularly imprinted contact lenses in enhancing the drug-loading capacity and controlling the drug release, compared to other ocular drug delivery systems.

drug,Drug delivery through soft contact lenses: An introduction,"Current ophthalmic drug delivery systems are insufficient, specifically eye drops, which allow approximately 95% of the drug contained in the drops to be lost due to absorption through the conjunctiva or through the tear drainage. The use of soft contact lenses has been proposed as a method to deliver drugs to the eye in an efficient manner. The contact lenses restrict the drug from being lost to tear drainage by releasing the drug into two tear layers on either side of the contact lens, where it ultimately diffuses into the eye. By using loaded soft contact lenses, continuous drug release for extended period is possible.

drug,Preparation of a Molecularly Imprinted Soft Contact Lens as a New Ocular Drug Delivery System for Dorzolamide,"In the present work a series of imprinted (MIPs) and non-imprinted (NIPs) hydrogels were prepared using 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as a backbone monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as a cross-linker monomer, methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer and dorzolamide (DZD) as the template molecule. Different concentrations of MAA (0, 100, 200, 400 mM) were used for preparation of NIPs. Two DZD: MAA molar ratios (1:8 and 1:4) and 400 mM MAA were also applied in imprinting process. The hydrogels (0.4 mm thickness) were synthesized by thermal polymerization at 50°C in 24h in a polypropylene mould. Then, the swelling and binding properties of hydrogels were evaluated in water. Their loading and releasing properties were also studied in NaCl 0.9% and artificial lachrymal fluid. The results showed that using MAA as co-monomer and applying molecular imprinting technique increased loading capacity of hydrogels. The optimized imprinted hydrogel (MIP1:4), prepared with 400 mM MAA and DZD: MAA molar ratio of 1:4, had the highest affinity for DZD and the greatest ability to control the release process in aqueous media. Our data indicated that the use of suitable co-monomer and applying a molecular imprinting technique had important influence on loading and releasing properties of hydrogels.",2013-05-01,B Malaekeh Nikouei,Seyedeh Atefeh Vahabzadeh,Mashhad University of Medical Sciences,IR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,In vitro release of two anti-muscarinic drugs from soft contact lenses,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the release of the anti-myopia drugs atropine sulfate and pirenzepine dihydrochloride from commercially available soft contact lenses. Standard ultraviolet (UV) absorbance-concentration curves were generated for atropine and pirenzepine. Ten commercially available contact lenses, including four multifocal lenses, were loaded by soaking in atropine or pirenzepine solutions at two different concentrations (10 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL). The release of the drugs into phosphate-buffered saline was determined over the course of 24 hours at 34°C using UV absorbance. Materials with surface charge released the greatest amount of atropine when loaded with either concentration when compared to the other lens types (p<0.05), releasing upward of 1.026±0.035 mg/lens and 0.979±0.024 mg/lens from etafilcon A and ocufilcon A, respectively. There were no significant differences in the amount of atropine or pirenzepine released from the multifocal and non-multifocal lenses made from the same lens materials. Narafilcon A material demonstrated prolonged release of up to 8 hours when loaded with pirenzepine, although the overall dose delivered from the lens into the solution was among the lowest of the materials investigated. The rest of the lenses reached a plateau within 2 hours of release, suggesting that they were unable to sustain drug release into the solution for long periods of time. Given that no single method of myopia control has yet shown itself to be completely effective in preventing myopia progression, a combination of optical and pharmaceutical devices comprising a drug delivering contact lens presents a novel solution that warrants further investigation.",2017-09-01,Alex Hui,Magdalena Bajgrowicz,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

Chlorpheniramine maleate and sodium cromoglycate were used to measure the drug uptake into the SCL.The results showed the largest drug uptake into the anionic SCL accompanied with dimensional changes and lower drug uptakes into the nonionic and the zwitter ionic SCL with dimensional stability. The cell permeability of the substances when instilled in the eye over the SCL was also measured. The zwitter ionic SCL allowed cell permeability comparable to that by oral administration.These results indicated the possibility for the zwitter ionic SCL as a lens to be worn concomitantly with ophthalmic drug instillation.",2006-07-01,Masumi Kanemoto,Takao Sato,Juntendo University,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Soft Contact Lens with Embedded Microtubes for Sustained and Self-Adaptive Drug Delivery for Glaucoma Treatment,"Because of the physiological and anatomical constraints of the eye, ophthalmic drug delivery is challenging. When applied topically, less than 1% of administered ophthalmic drugs reach the aqueous humor. The delivery of a drug within an efficient therapeutic concentration, to the required site of action, for an extended period of time, is complicated. Herein, a novel type of contact lens device, with embedded microtubes as drug containers, is reported. This device can provide a simple, noninvasive, extended drug release up to 45 days with higher bioavailability and lower risk for adverse effects. Another unique feature of the device is the release of drug triggered by stretching of the contact lens, indicating the possibility for achieving a self-adaptive drug release device for treating glaucoma patients.",2020-09-22,Xiaoke Ding,Gil Ben‐Shlomo,Iowa State University,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Drug release from liposome coated hydrogels for soft contact lenses: the blinking and temperature effect,"In this article, liposome-based coatings aiming to control drug release from therapeutic soft contact lenses (SCLs) materials are analyzed. A PHEMA based hydrogel material loaded with levofloxacin is used as model system for this research. The coatings are formed by polyelectrolyte layers containing liposomes of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and DMPC + cholesterol (DMPC + CHOL). The effect of friction and temperature on the drug release is investigated. The aim of the friction tests is to simulate the blinking of the eyelid in order to verify if the SCLs materials coated with liposomes are able to keep their properties, in particular the drug release ability. It was observed that under the study conditions, friction did not affect significantly the drug release from the liposome coated PHEMA material. In contrast, increasing the temperature of release leads to an increase of the drug diffusion rate through the hydrogel. This phenomenon is recorded both in the control and in the coated samples. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

drug,Adsorption of Actives in Ophthalmological Drugs for Over-The-Counter on Soft Contact Lens Surfaces,"The adsorption of various kinds of ionic/nonionic actives, added in ophthalmological drugs (artificial tear, contact lens wetting solution, eye-drops, and eyewash) for over-the-counter (marketable drugs with no need of any medical prescription) , on soft contact lens (SCL) surfaces has been studied as a function of hydrophobicity of the actives. The common logarithm of the 1-octanol/water partitioning coefficient (AC_log P) has been used in order to normalize the hydrophobicity of the actives employed in this study. No significant adsorption occurs for relatively hydrophilic actives, whereas the adsorption rate is gradually increased with an increase in the hydrophobicity of the actives. This suggests that the adsorption is predominantly governed by the hydrophobic interaction of the actives with the SCL surfaces, although an electrostatic interaction plays an additional role for the adsorption. The most effective adsorption occurs in the following active-lens combinations: cationic actives--the anionic and hydrated lens IV (methacrylic acid-based SCL); anionic actives---the nonionic and hydrated lens II (N-vinyl pyrrolidone-based SCL); and nonionic actives--the anionic and less-hydrated lens III (containing hydrophobic silicone monomers).",2009-01-01,Nobuhito Tabuchi,Tadashi Watanabe,Lion Corporation (Japan),JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Soft Materials by Design: Unconventional Polymer Networks Give Extreme Properties,"Hydrogels are polymer networks infiltrated with water. Many biological hydrogels in animal bodies such as muscles, heart valves, cartilages, and tendons possess extreme mechanical properties including being extremely tough, strong, resilient, adhesive, and fatigue-resistant. These mechanical properties are also critical for hydrogels' diverse applications ranging from drug delivery, tissue engineering, medical implants, wound dressings, and contact lenses to sensors, actuators, electronic devices, optical devices, batteries, water harvesters, and soft robots. Whereas numerous hydrogels have been developed over the last few decades, a set of general principles that can rationally guide the design of hydrogels using different materials and fabrication methods for various applications remain a central need in the field of soft materials. This review is aimed at synergistically reporting: (i) general design principles for hydrogels to achieve extreme mechanical and physical properties, (ii) implementation strategies for the design principles using unconventional polymer networks, and (iii) future directions for the orthogonal design of hydrogels to achieve multiple combined mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological properties. Because these design principles and implementation strategies are based on generic polymer networks, they are also applicable to other soft materials including elastomers and organogels.

drug,Ocular Drug Delivery into the Eyes Using Drug-Releasing Soft Contact Lens,"The impact of visual impairment, such as blindness, on quality of life is immeasurable. However, effective ocular drug delivery into the eyes has not yet been established, primarily due to the impermeability imposed by the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) based on the tight junctions and efflux transporters at the endothelium or the epithelium in oral or intravenous administration, as well as the dilution with tear fluid and excretion through the nasolacrimal duct in eye drop administration. Furthermore, intravitreous injections induce pain and fear in patients. Unmet medical needs persist in ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, innovative non-invasive administration methods should be developed. Drug-releasing soft contact lenses (DR-SCLs) affixed to the eye’s surface can continuously and locally deliver their loaded drugs to the eyes. The use of DR-SCLs is expected to greatly enhance the bioavailability and patient adherence to the drug regimen. It is known that several solute carrier (SLC) transporters are expressed in various parts of the eyes, including the cornea, the ciliary body, and the bulbar conjunctiva. Carrier-mediated transport through SLC transporters may occur in addition to passive diffusion. Moreover, nanoparticles can be loaded into DR-SCLs, offering various intelligent approaches based on modifications to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis/transcytosis or to control the loaded drug release within this delivery system. In this perspective review, I discuss the implementation and potential of DR-SCL-mediated ocular drug delivery, particularly focusing on low-molecular-weight compounds because of their fine distribution in living body, ease of handling, and ease of manufacturing.",2024-04-29,Toshihiko Tashima,,Hamamatsu Photonics (Japan),JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Equilibrium Binding Interactions Between Lotrafilcon A Soft Contact Lenses and the Two Prostaglandin Antiglaucoma Drugs Bimatoprost and Tafluprost,"Objectives: To determine the equilibrium binding constant (EB) values of bimatoprost and tafluprost drug product formulations in contact with lotrafilcon A soft contact lenses and to characterize the importance of drug molecule hydrophobicity in controlling the binding interactions. Methods: Bimatoprost Ophthalmic Solution and Tafluprost Ophthalmic Solution (Saflutan) were incubated with lotrafilcon A lens material for timed intervals at 25°C and 37°C. Aliquots were withdrawn, filtered, and tested using reverse-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with respect to [bimatoprost] or [tafluprost] remaining in the solution. A series of homologous dialkyl phthalate esters and a series of homologous p-hydroxybenzoic acid alkyl esters were also tested as reference compounds. Results: Bimatoprost and tafluprost were rapidly (within 15 min) absorbed from the solution by lotrafilcon A lenses, reaching an equilibrium within 60 min. At any lens:solution (w/v) ratio, the extent of drug binding to lens material was greater for tafluprost than for bimatoprost. The log(EB) values correlated with solute octanol:water partition coefficient (logP) values, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are important in controlling solute partitioning into the lens material. Conclusions: This study established the quantitative relationships between tafluprost and bimatoprost binding to lotrafilcon A lenses. The fraction of bimatoprost or tafluprost that binds to lotrafilcon A increases with increasing lens:solution (w/v) ratio. For a 60 µL dose volume applied to a single contact lens, 16% of initially present bimatoprost remains in the solution, whereas only 6% of initially present tafluprost remains in the solution. These calculations clearly demonstrate that both drugs partition extensively into lotrafilcon A contact lens material. Although the clinical implications of such binding can only be surmised, it would seem prudent to caution contact lens wearers to remove the lenses before administering either prostaglandin drug.",2013-06-14,Richard A.

drug,Hydrogel Contact Lens for Extended Delivery of Ophthalmic Drugs,"Soft contact lenses can improve the bioavailability and prolong the residence time of drugs and, therefore, are ideal drug carriers for ophthalmic drug delivery. Hydrogels are the leading materials of soft contact lenses because of their biocompatibility and transparent characteristic. In order to increase the amount of load drug and to control their release at the expected intervals, many strategies are developed to modify the conventional contact lens as well as the novel hydrogel contact lenses that include (i) polymeric hydrogels with controlled hydrophilic/hydrophobic copolymer ratio; (ii) hydrogels for inclusion of drugs in a colloidal structure dispersed in the contact lenses; (iii) ligand-containing hydrogels; (iv) molecularly imprinted polymeric hydrogels; (v) hydrogel with the surface containing multilayer structure for drugs loading and releasing.

drug,Changes in Drug Elution Concentration and Physical Characteristics of Soft Contact Lenses Depending on the Initiator and Crosslinker,"목적: 개시제와 교차결합제의 농도에 따른 소프트콘택트렌즈의 재질을 변화시켜서 재질변화에 대한 물리적 특성 및 약물의 용출량 및 속도를 비교하였다. 방법: HEMA에 개시제인 AIBN과 교차결합제인 EGDMA의 농도을 변화시켜서 콘택트렌즈를 제작하였다. 항균물질인 노플록사신(norfloxacin)은 고분자 중합 시 0.1% 농도로 단량체와 함께 혼합하였다. 재질변화에 따른 물리적 성질 변화를 확인하기 위해 약물용출 농도, 함수율, 굴절률, 단백질 흡착량 등에 대한 실험을 통하여 비교하였으며, 통계분석을 통해 유의성을 확인하였다. 결과: 개시제의 농도을 변화 시킨 콘택트렌즈는 함수율의 변화가 거의 없으며, 굴절률의 값에도 별 변화가 없었다. 교차결합제 농도이 증가하면 함수율이 낮아지고 굴절률이 높아졌다. 약물용출의 농도를 살펴보면 개시제의 변화에 의해서는 많은 변화를 보이지 않았으며, 함수율이 높을수록 용출되는 농도가 증가하였다. 단백질 흡착양은 개시제에 의한 변화는 거의 없었으며 함수율이 낮을수록 흡착되는 양이 증가하였다. 결론: 개시제의 농도에 대한 변화는 특성 변화에 영향력이 거의 없었으며, 교차결합제 농도에 따라서는 많은 변화를 보였다. 교차결합제의 농도가 증가할수록 함수율은 감소하며 굴절률은 증가하였다. 또한 함수율의 증가에 따라 약물이 많이 용출되었으며 단백질의 흡착량은 감소되었다. Purpose: The material properties of contact lenses were measured by varying the amounts of an initiator and a cross-linking agent that are the basis for the manufacture of contact lenses, and the drug delivery effects depending on the material properties of contact lenses were compared. Methods: Contact lens samples were manufactured using HEMA by varying the concentration of the cross-linking agent and the initiator. To investigate the changes in physical characteristics depending on the material properties, the results of the experiments on the amount of drug elution, water content, refractive index, and the amount of protein adsorption were compared. Results: For the contact lenses manufactured by varying the amount of the initiator, the water content hardly changed, and the refractive index also hardly changed. The amount of drug elution was not much affected by the changes in the initiator, but the amount of elution increased as the water content increased. The amount of protein adsorption was hardly affected by the changes in the initiator, but the amount of adsorption increased as the water content decreased. Conclusions: The changes in the properties were hardly affected by the changes in the amount of the initiator, but were significantly affected by the changes in the amount of the cross-linking agent. As the amount of the cross-linking agent increased, the water content decreased, while the refractive index increased. Also, when the water content increased, the amount of drug elution increased, while the amount of protein adsorption decreased.",2014-06-30,Hyun‐Ju Park,Hyun Mee Lee,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,New Approach to Drug Delivery in Ophthalmological Practice: Development of Composite Ophthalmological Solution for Drug Loading of Soft Contact Lenses,"Introduction . This article provides a tentative justification of use of soft contact lenses as a carrier of ophthalmological solutions to eye tissues. Aim . The aim of the research is to develop the composition of the ophthalmic transport system for the treatment of glaucoma. Also, the proposed manufacturing algorithms were proposed for drug loading ophthalmological solutions. Materials and methods . Preparation of sodium hyaluronate solution was carried out based on the methodology described in EP 7.0 [01/2011:1472] (Sodium hyaluronate). Results and discussion . The conducted investigation with the purpose to justify a concentration of sodium hyaluronate helped to determine its concentration that gives the viscosity level as close to the upper limit stated in Russian Pharmacopoeia as possible. Buffer solution was chosen with criteria to use as less components in ophthalmological solution as possible. Also, it was found out that the more components are added to the viscous solution, the more viscosity level is decreased. Thus, initial viscosity of solution containing sodium hyaluronate was 149.59 mm 2 /s, and after addition of active pharmaceutical substance it dropped down to 88.49 mm 2 /s and 81.36 mm 2 /s for model solution number 1 and 2, respectively. After addition of citric acid and disodium hydrophosphate, the viscosity of model solution was found to be 78.11 mm 2 /s and 75.28 mm 2 /s for model solution number 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion . As a result of the studies, two alternative model compositions of an ophthalmic solution for the saturation of soft contact lenses for the treatment of glaucoma were proposed. The choice of active pharmaceutical substances, and excipients has been justified. Technological procedure of preparation of model solution was described and explained, where the most attention was paid on dissolving of sodium hyaluronate in purified water.",2020-11-26,Denis K.

drug,A novel approach to achieve semi-sustained drug delivery to the eye through asymmetric loading of soft contact lenses,"Soft contact lenses are increasingly being explored as a vehicle for controlled delivery of ophthalmic drugs. However, traditional methods of drug-loading by soaking have limitations such as burst delivery and the release of drugs at the front side of the lens, leading to poor drug efficacy and systemic side effects. This study introduces a new methodology, termed asymmetric drug loading, whereby the ophthalmic drug 'Rebamipide' is attached to and released from the post-lens (=cornea-contacting) surface exclusively. The methodology involves using polymeric microparticles that carry a lipophilic crystalline ophthalmic drug at their surface. These drug-loaded microparticles first transfer the drug to the concave surface of the contact lens, and when worn, the drug is transferred again, now from the lens to the cornea. This is achieved through the diffusion of the drug from one hydrophobic microenvironment (the silicone moieties of the contact lens polymer network) to another hydrophobic microenvironment (the corneal epithelium) over a short pathway. The second drug transfer was observed and studied in experiments using an ex vivo porcine eye model. The results show that the drug amount that was absorbed by the cornea after applying the rebamipide-loaded contact lenses is approximately 3× (10.7 ± 3.1 μg) as much as the amount of rebamipide that gets transferred after the instillation of one eye drop (1% solution (p < 0.001). The new drug-loading method offers a practical and reproducible means of delivering ophthalmic drugs to the cornea through soft contact lenses. The drug payloads achieved are comparable to dosages used during eye drop therapy.",2023-06-01,Malake Sarmout,Yutang Xiao,Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College,CN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it explores a novel method for drug delivery via soft contact lenses, which aligns directly with the company's focus on soft contact lenses in the context of manufacturing and drug incorporation.

drug,New drug delivery system in ophthalmology: results studying the surface structure of soft contact lenses from various polymer,"The development of an ophthalmic therapeutic system includes research on the spatial structure of soft contact lens polymers and the study of the processes of saturation and release of medicinal substances from them. This allows you to determine the methods of saturation of contact lenses with medicinal agents and will open up new opportunities in the treatment of ophthalmological diseases. The purpose of this preliminary fragment of large-scale research was to study the surface structure of soft contact lenses made of various polymers. The following polymers were used in the work: Nelfilcon A, Hilafilcon B, Nezofilcon A, Etafilcon A, Lotrafilcon B. The following pharmaceutical substances were used: Brimonidine Tartrate, Betaxolol Hydrochloride, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride. The surface structure of soft contact lenses was studied using atomic force microscopy. Each material under study has a different surface character, which together with the differences in pore properties determines its individuality. Based on this, it should be assumed that the surface of soft contact lenses affects the possibility of their potential use as a means of delivering drug agent molecules to the eye tissues. In all cases of soft contact saturation, the highest absorption capacity was demonstrated by Hilafilcon B and Etafilcon A with a similar surface.",2021-01-01,E. T. Zhilyakova,Denis K.

drug,Nanoparticle-Laden Contact Lens for Controlled Ocular Delivery of Prednisolone: Formulation Optimization Using Statistical Experimental Design,"Human eye is one of the most accessible organs in the body, nonetheless, its physiology and associated precorneal factors such as nasolacrimal drainage, blinking, tear film, tear turnover, and induced lacrimation has significantly decreased the residence time of any foreign substances including pharmaceutical dosage forms. Soft contact lenses are promising delivery devices that can sustain the drug release and prolong residence time by acting as a geometric barrier to drug diffusion to tear fluid. This study investigates experimental parameters such as composition of polymer mixtures, stabilizer and the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient on the preparation of a polymeric drug delivery system for the topical ocular administration of Prednisolone. To achieve this goal, prednisolone-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were prepared by single emulsion solvent evaporation method. Prednisolone was quantified using a validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Nanoparticle size was mostly affected by the amount of co-polymer (PLGA) used whereas drug load was mostly affected by amount of prednisolone (API) used. Longer homogenization time along with higher amount of API yielded the smallest size nanoparticles. The nanoparticles prepared had an average particle size of 347.1 ± 11.9 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.081. The nanoparticles were then incorporated in the contact lens mixture before preparing them. Clear and transparent contact lenses were successfully prepared. When the nanoparticle (NP)-loaded contact lenses were compared with control contact lenses (unloaded NP contact lenses), a decrease in hydration by 2% (31.2% ± 1.25% hydration for the 0.2 g loaded NP contact lenses) and light transmission by 8% (unloaded NP contact lenses 94.5% NP 0.2 g incorporated contact lenses 86.23%). The wettability of the contact lenses remained within the desired value (<90 °C) even upon incorporation of the NP. NP alone and NP-loaded contact lenses both displayed a slow in vitro drug release of drug over 24 h; where 42.3% and 10.8% prednisolone release were achieved, respectively. Contact lenses can be used as a medicated device to sustain ocular drug delivery and improve patient compliance; nonetheless, patients and healthcare professionals' acceptability and perceptions of the new formulations entail further investigations.",2016-04-20,Amr ElShaer,Shelan M.

drug,Uptake and Release of Ciprofloxacin-HCl From Conventional and Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lens Materials,"Objectives. To investigate the uptake and release characteristics of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin-HCl in conventional and silicone hydrogel lenses, and evaluate their potential as therapeutic drug delivery devices. Methods. Nine differing soft contact lens materials were soaked in a 0.3% ciprofloxacin-HCl solution at 34°C. The uptake of the drug into the lenses was measured by the change in concentration over 24 hours using fluorescence spectrophotometry. The lenses were then placed in a buffered saline solution, and the release of the drug from the lenses was also measured using spectrophotometry. Results. The release of drug varied from 0.016 ± 0.004 mg/lens for lotrafilcon A lenses to 0.42 ± 0.03 mg/lens for etafilcon A lenses, with an average of 0.133 mg/lens. The 3 conventional lenses used in the study released a statistically significantly different amount of drug when compared with the silicone hydrogels. The release of drug was very rapid, with drug release reaching a plateau after no more than 10 minutes for the majority of the lenses. The majority of the lenses were able to release enough drug to achieve minimum inhibitory concentration 90 for most resistant ocular pathogens. Ciprofloxacin was found to heavily precipitate on the etafilcon A lenses during the release phase at physiologic pH. Conclusion. While balafilcon A released the most drug from the silicone hydrogel materials, all materials released the drug too quickly to be effective as drug delivery devices.",2008-09-01,Alex Hui,Adrienne N.

drug,Controlling myopia progression in children and adolescents,"Abstract: Myopia is a common disorder, affecting approximately one-third of the US population and over 90% of the population in some East Asian countries. High amounts of myopia are associated with an increased risk of sight-threatening problems, such as retinal detachment, choroidal degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma. Slowing the progression of myopia could potentially benefit millions of children in the USA. To date, few strategies used for myopia control have proven to be effective. Treatment options such as undercorrection of myopia, gas permeable contact lenses, and bifocal or multifocal spectacles have all been proven to be ineffective for myopia control, although one recent randomized clinical trial using executive top bifocal spectacles on children with progressive myopia has shown to decrease the progression to nearly half of the control subjects. The most effective methods are the use of orthokeratology contact lenses, soft bifocal contact lenses, and topical pharmaceutical agents such as atropine or pirenzepine. Although none of these modalities are US Food and Drug Administration-approved to slow myopia progression, they have been shown to slow the progression by approximately 50% with few risks. Both orthokeratology and soft bifocal contact lenses have shown to slow myopia progression by slightly less than 50% in most studies. Parents and eye care practitioners should work together to determine which modality may be best suited for a particular child. Topical pharmaceutical agents such as anti-muscarinic eye drops typically lead to light sensitivity and poor near vision. The most effective myopia control is provided by atropine, but is rarely prescribed due to the side effects. Pirenzepine provides myopia control with little light sensitivity and few near-vision problems, but it is not yet commercially available as an eye drop or ointment. Several studies have shown that lower concentrations of atropine slow the progression of myopia control with fewer side effects than 1% atropine. While the progression of myopic refractive error is slowed with lower concentration of atropine, the growth of the eye is not, indicating a potentially reversible form of myopia control that may diminish after discontinuation of the eye drops. This review provides an overview of the myopia control information available in the literature and raises questions that remain unanswered, so that eye care practitioners and parents can potentially learn the methods that may ultimately improve a child's quality of life or lower the risk of sight-threatening complications.

drug,Application of polymer gels containing side‐chain phosphate groups to drug‐delivery contact lenses,"Abstract Hydrogels that contain phosphate groups in side chains were studied for their usefulness in drug‐delivery soft contact lenses (SCLs). Naphazoline, a model drug having a cationic group, was incorporated into an SCL because of its phosphate groups and was released over a period of about 14 h. For the SCL, the naphazoline content was equivalent to the phosphate group content. It is suggested that drug‐delivery SCLs can be designed to contain the needed amount of a drug through the choice of the ionic group for the ligand. Furthermore, the SCL having amide groups and phosphate groups had high transparency and an unchanged shape. It is suggested that amide groups and phosphate groups must be introduced into the polymer in equimolar amounts to give the necessary polymer–drug interaction. Therefore, hydrogels having a drug‐delivery system were synthesized by the inclusion of a phosphate group and an amide group. These hydrogels are also applicable to SCL materials. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

drug,Dynamic Hydrogels from Host–Guest Supramolecular Interactions,"Abstract Hydrogel biomaterials are pervasive in biomedical use. Applications of these soft materials range from contact lenses to drug depots to scaffolds for transplanted cells. A subset of hydrogels is prepared from physical cross‐linking mediated by host–guest interactions. Host macrocycles, the most recognizable supramolecular motif, facilitate complex formation with an array of guests by inclusion in their portal. Commonly, an appended macrocycle forms a complex with appended guests on another polymer chain. The formation of poly(pseudo)rotaxanes is also demonstrated, wherein macrocycles are threaded by a polymer chain to give rise to physical cross‐linking by secondary non‐covalent interactions or polymer jamming. Host–guest supramolecular hydrogels lend themselves to a variety of applications resulting from their dynamic properties that arise from non‐covalent supramolecular interactions, as well as engineered responsiveness to external stimuli. These are thus an exciting new class of materials.",2018-10-10,Siena M. Mantooth,Brizzia G. Munoz‐Robles,University of Notre Dame,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Ocular Penetration of Prednisolone and the Hydrophilic Contact Lens,"Ocular penetration of prednisolone sodium phosphate was studied with and without the physiological hydrophilic polymer soft contact lens in rabbits. In one group corticosteroid was administered topically after the lens was in place. In another group the lens was presoaked for two minutes in corticosteroid before being applied to the eye. The levels of corticosteroid that were obtained in aqueous, cornea, and iris were compared to topical administration without the lens. Aqueous and corneal levels of corticosteroid were maintained twofold to three-fold higher at four hours in eyes with the presoaked lens than in eyes receiving the drug topically without the lens. Application of the drug topically to a soft lens already in place in the eye resulted in diminished corticosteroid levels in the anterior segment at one and two hours.",1974-11-01,D. Hull,Henry F.

drug,Imprinted Hydrogels with LbL Coating for Dual Drug Release from Soft Contact Lenses Materials,"A combined strategy to control the release of two drugs, one anti-inflammatory (diclofenac sodium, DCF) and one antibiotic (moxifloxacin hydrochloride, MXF), from a soft contact lens (SCL) material, was assessed. The material was a silicone-based hydrogel, which was modified by molecular imprinting with MXF and coated by the layer-by-layer (LbL) method using natural polyelectrolytes: alginate (ALG), poly-L-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronate (HA) hyaluronate), crosslinked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Imprinting was used to increase the amount of MXF loaded and to sustain its release, while the LbL coating acted as a diffusion barrier for DCF and improved the surface properties. The drugs were loaded by soaking in a DCF+MXF dual solution. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) was successfully applied in the sterilization of the drug-loaded hydrogels. The transmittance, refractive index, wettability and ionic permeability of the hydrogels remained within the required levels for SCLs application. The concentrations of the released DCF and MXF stayed above the IC50 and the MIC (for S. aureus and S. epidermidis) values, for 9 and 10 days, respectively.

drug,Bioinspired Imprinted PHEMA-Hydrogels for Ocular Delivery of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor Drugs,"Hydrogels with high affinity for carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor drugs have been designed trying to mimic the active site of the physiological metallo-enzyme receptor. Using hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as the backbone component, zinc methacrylate, 1- or 4-vinylimidazole (1VI or 4VI), and N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (HEAA) were combined at different ratios to reproduce in the hydrogels the cone-shaped cavity of the CA, which contains a Zn2+ ion coordinated to three histidine residues. 4VI resembles histidine functionality better than 1VI, and, consequently, pHEMA-ZnMA2 hydrogels bearing 4VI moieties were those with the greatest ability to host acetazolamide or ethoxzolamide (2 to 3 times greater network/water partition coefficient) and to sustain the release of these antiglaucoma drugs (50% lower release rate estimated by fitting to the square root kinetics). The use of acetazolamide as template during polymerization did not enhance the affinity of the network for the drugs. In addition to the remarkable improvement in the performance as controlled release systems, the biomimetic hydrogels were highly cytocompatible and possessed adequate oxygen permeability to be used as medicated soft contact lenses or inserts.

drug,Water soluble drug releasing soft contact lens in response to pH of tears,"Human tear characteristics including pH and compositions can vary significantly depending on physical and environmental factors. Contact lenses directly contact with human tears can be swelled or de-swelled depending on the pH of the solution due to the nature of the hydrogel. For examples, anionic hydrogels, when the solution's pH is low, is shrunken due to the electric attraction force within the hydrogel network; the opposite phenomenon appears when the solution is basic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of water soluble drug, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose, released from contact lens according to the pH of the artificial tears. Artificial tears are prepared by mixing lysozyme, albumin, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride following physiological concentrations. Hydrogel contact lens was thermally polymerized using HEMA, EGDMA, and AIBN. The prepared hydrogel lens was immersed in drug for 3 hours and the eluted drug mass was measured as a function of the time. As a result, the drug was released from the lens for 12 hours in all the pH of artificial tears. At the lower pH of artificial tears (pH 5.8), the total amount of dye emitted from the lens was increased than the total amount of dye emitted at the basic tear (pH 8.4). Also, initial burst at acidic tears was increased within 1 hour. Release pattern of water-soluble drug from hydrogel lens turned out to be different depending on the pH of the artificial tears. When designing drug releasing contact lens, physiological pH of tears should be considered.",2016-06-01,G Kim,Hyeran Noh,Convergence,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,A Contact Lens-Based Technique for Expansion and Transplantation of Autologous Epithelial Progenitors for Ocular Surface Reconstruction,"A healthy cornea is reliant on a distinct population of stem cells (SC) that replace damaged or aging epithelium throughout life. Depletion of the SC pool or damage to the niche can result in a blinding and painful condition known as limbal-SC deficiency (LSCD). Although current treatment strategies for reconstituting the ocular surface for patients suffering LSCD are promising, they are complicated by transferring autologous or allogeneic progenitors in the presence of animal, human, and synthetic products. We report on the safe and efficacy of a unique autologous SC transfer technique that utilizes an Food and Drug Administration-approved contact lens (CL) as the SC substrate and carrier for patients with LSCD.Three patients with LSCD due to aniridia (n=1) and posttreatment for recurrent ocular surface melanoma (n=2) were included. Limbal (n=2) or conjunctival biopsies (n=1) were harvested and progenitors expanded ex vivo on therapeutic CLs in the presence of autologous serum. Cell-laden CLs were transferred to the patient's corneal surface and clinical outcome measures were recorded (follow-up range, 8-13 months).A stable transparent corneal epithelium was restored in each patient. There was no recurrence of conjunctivalization or corneal vascularization, and a significant improvement in symptom score occurred in all patients. Best-corrected visual acuity was increased in all eyes after the procedure.Ex vivo expansion of ocular surface epithelium in the presence of autologous serum and transplantation with the aid of a soft CLs is a promising new technique capable of achieving ocular surface rehabilitation.",2009-05-21,Nick Di Girolamo,Martina M.
