emerging technologies,Poly(2-Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate) Hydrogels for Contact Lens Applications–A Review,"The emerging technology in biomedical engineering requires biocompatible materials, which are also referred to as biomaterials. For a material to be considered biocompatible, it should not interact with human tissues in a harmful way, and vice versa. Various properties of biocompatible materials, such as mechanical and optical properties, have to be considered for different biomedical applications. One of the most popular applications of biomaterials is for contact lenses. Hydrogels, specifically poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogels, are among the most popular ones in ophthalmologic applications, especially in soft contact lenses. This paper reviews the use of PHEMA hydrogels as one of the important biomaterials. The possible applications, properties, and manufacturing process of PHEMA hydrogels, especially in contact lens applications, are addressed. Many studies have shown that PHEMA hydrogels possess many advantages in contact lens applications and have promising development prospects.",2021-09-29,Kushendarsyah Saptaji,Nurlaely Rohmatul,Sampoerna University,ID,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

emerging technologies,Soft Lithography Using Nectar Droplets,"In spite of significant advances in replication technologies, methods to produce well-defined three-dimensional structures are still at its infancy. Such a limitation would be evident if we were to produce a large array of simple and, especially, compound convex lenses, also guaranteeing that their surfaces would be molecularly smooth. Here, we report a novel method to produce such structures by cloning the 3D shape of nectar drops, found widely in nature, using conventional soft lithography.The elementary process involves transfer of a thin patch of the sugar solution coated on a glass slide onto a hydrophobic substrate on which this patch evolves into a microdroplet. Upon the absorption of water vapor, such a microdroplet grows linearly with time, and its final size can be controlled by varying its exposure time to water vapor. At any stage of the evolution of the size of the drop, its shape can be cloned onto a soft elastomer by following the well-known methods of molding and cross-linking the same. A unique new science that emerges in our attempt to understand the transfer of the sugar patch and its evolution to a spherical drop is the elucidation of the mechanics underlying the contact of a deformable sphere against a solid support intervening a thin liquid film. A unique aspect of this work is to demonstrate that higher level structures can also be generated by transferring even smaller nucleation sites on the surface of the primary lenses and then allowing them to grow by absorption of water vapor. What results at the end is either a well-controlled distribution of smooth hemispherical lenses or compound structures that could have potential applications in the fundamental studies of contact mechanics, wettability, and even in optics.",2015-11-13,Saheli Biswas,Aditi Chakrabarti,Lehigh University,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

emerging technologies,Wearable smart sensor systems integrated on soft contact lenses for wireless ocular diagnostics,"Abstract Wearable contact lenses which can monitor physiological parameters have attracted substantial interests due to the capability of direct detection of biomarkers contained in body fluids. However, previously reported contact lens sensors can only monitor a single analyte at a time. Furthermore, such ocular contact lenses generally obstruct the field of vision of the subject. Here, we developed a multifunctional contact lens sensor that alleviates some of these limitations since it was developed on an actual ocular contact lens. It was also designed to monitor glucose within tears, as well as intraocular pressure using the resistance and capacitance of the electronic device. Furthermore, in-vivo and in-vitro tests using a live rabbit and bovine eyeball demonstrated its reliable operation. Our developed contact lens sensor can measure the glucose level in tear fluid and intraocular pressure simultaneously but yet independently based on different electrical responses.",2017-04-27,Joohee Kim,Minji Kim,Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,KR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

emerging technologies,What we know about the scleral profile and its impact on contact lens fitting,"Scleral contact lens fitting has provided practitioners with one of the earliest pieces of evidence that the sclera was more often asymmetric than symmetric. Some preliminary observations such as different haptic alignment patterns over the sclera in 360 degrees, the appearance of fogging in the fluid chamber and excessive tear out-in flow through specific meridians, quadrants, or areas of the haptic provide evidence of some scleral asymmetry. The advent of technologies that allowed measurement of the scleral profile led to formal research confirming that only about 6% of scleras are symmetric, while the rest are toric, quad-specific, or irregular. This has an evident impact on how to focus scleral lens fitting. Measuring the scleral profile also provided us with true ocular sagittal height data for cord diameters beyond the cornea. Although high variability was expected in pathological eyes, healthy eyes also showed a wide range of ocular sagittal heights. Due to this variability among healthy eyes, a discussion has emerged on whether the one-size-fits-all approach to soft lens fitting is a proper strategy to fit the whole spectrum of sagittal heights. The traditional mode of selecting the parameters for custom soft lenses through corneal parameters is also questioned.",2022-07-11,Javier Rojas-Viñuela,Melanie J Frogozo,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

on-demand manufacturing,"Wearable sensors: modalities, challenges, and prospects","Wearable sensors have recently seen a large increase in both research and commercialization. However, success in wearable sensors has been a mix of both progress and setbacks. Most of commercial progress has been in smart adaptation of existing mechanical, electrical and optical methods of measuring the body. This adaptation has involved innovations in how to miniaturize sensing technologies, how to make them conformal and flexible, and in the development of companion software that increases the value of the measured data. However, chemical sensing modalities have experienced greater challenges in commercial adoption, especially for non-invasive chemical sensors. There have also been significant challenges in making significant fundamental improvements to existing mechanical, electrical, and optical sensing modalities, especially in improving their specificity of detection. Many of these challenges can be understood by appreciating the body's surface (skin) as more of an information barrier than as an information source. With a deeper understanding of the fundamental challenges faced for wearable sensors and of the state-of-the-art for wearable sensor technology, the roadmap becomes clearer for creating the next generation of innovations and breakthroughs.",2017-11-28,Jason Heikenfeld,Andrew J.

These requirements include optical transparency, conformal fitting, and flexibility comparable with soft contact lenses (e.g., hydrogel‐based). Moreover, the viscoelastic nature of TPU allows planar structures to be thermoformed into spherical caps with a well‐defined curvature (i.e., eye's curvature at the cornea: 9 mm). Numerical modeling and experimental validation enable fine‐tuning of the thermoforming parameters and the optimization of strain‐release patterns. Such tight control is proven necessary to achieve oxygen permeable, thin, nondevelopable, and wrinkle‐free contact lenses with integrated electronics (silicon die, radio‐frequency antenna, and stretchable thin‐film interconnections).

smart lenses,Intraocular Pressure Monitoring Following Islet Transplantation to the Anterior Chamber of the Eye,"Intraocular islet transplantation was investigated as a new procedure to treat diabetes. The development of this procedure requires close monitoring of the function of both eye and islet graft. We developed a soft, smart contact lens to monitor the intraocular pressure and applied this for noninvasive monitoring in association with the intraocular islet transplantation in diabetes. A strain sensor inside the lens can detect detailed changes in intraocular pressure by focusing the strain only in the desired, selective area of the contact lens. In addition, this smart contact lens can transmit the real-time value of the intraocular pressure wirelessly using an antenna. The wireless measurement of intraocular pressure that was obtained using this contact lens had a high correlation with the intraocular pressure measured by a rebound tonometer, thereby proving the good accuracy of the contact lens sensor. In the initial period, a slight elevation of intraocular pressure was observed, but the pressure returned to normal in the initial period after the transplantation. This type of monitoring will provide important information on potential changes in the intraocular pressure associated with the transplantation procedure, and it enables appropriate clinical safety steps to be taken, if needed.",2019-11-21,Joohee Kim,Jaeyoon Kim,Yonsei University,KR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

However, fabricating a wireless‐powered circuit on a moist, soft contact lens, via common dry lithography, makes producing smart contact lenses challenging. Here, electrochemically (EC) printing a wireless‐powered circuit onto a moist, soft contact lens is demonstrated. EC printing involves adding a conductive polymer at the interface between a metal contact and a hydrogel‐based contact lens, resulting in strong adhesion of the circuit to the lens without losing high power transfer efficiency (50%) from an eyeglass transmitter to the printed receiver lens. The energy transfer characteristics during eye movement are modeled using the Neumann equation and Kirchhoff's voltage law for wireless power transfer. The energy transfer efficiency between the eyeglass transmitter and the printed receiver lens is derived, and illumination of a wireless‐powered single light‐emitting diode display as a function of eye rotation angle is demonstrated.

In this publication, the embedding of a custom‐made and thermoformed Near‐Field Communication based circuit in a conventional soft CL is presented. The circuit is composed of gold tracks on polyimide between thermoplastic polyurethane layers (insert), while the lens is based on industry standard double‐molding process of poly(2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate) with proven compatibility with corneal tissue. The lens shows stable geometrical parameters (bevel landing area) thus enabling a practical implementation. Finite element method models are used to optimize the thermoforming process in order to provide a stable and desired curvature of the insert before the embedding process. While the insert is designed to allow oxygen transmission at the center of the lens, a custom‐made ultra‐compact radio‐frequency antenna provides communication and wireless power transfer both in air and inside saline solutions.

drug delivery,Development of ocular drug delivery systems using molecularly imprinted soft contact lenses,"Recently, significant advances have been made in order to optimize drug delivery to ocular tissues. The main problems in ocular drug delivery are poor bioavailability and uncontrollable drug delivery of conventional ophthalmic preparations (e.g. eye drops). Hydrogels have been investigated since 1965 as new ocular drug delivery systems. Increase of hydrogel loading capacity, optimization of drug residence time on the ocular surface and biocompatibility with the eye tissue has been the main focus of previous studies.

drug delivery,Ocular Drug Delivery into the Eyes Using Drug-Releasing Soft Contact Lens,"The impact of visual impairment, such as blindness, on quality of life is immeasurable. However, effective ocular drug delivery into the eyes has not yet been established, primarily due to the impermeability imposed by the blood–retinal barrier (BRB) based on the tight junctions and efflux transporters at the endothelium or the epithelium in oral or intravenous administration, as well as the dilution with tear fluid and excretion through the nasolacrimal duct in eye drop administration. Furthermore, intravitreous injections induce pain and fear in patients. Unmet medical needs persist in ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, innovative non-invasive administration methods should be developed. Drug-releasing soft contact lenses (DR-SCLs) affixed to the eye’s surface can continuously and locally deliver their loaded drugs to the eyes. The use of DR-SCLs is expected to greatly enhance the bioavailability and patient adherence to the drug regimen. It is known that several solute carrier (SLC) transporters are expressed in various parts of the eyes, including the cornea, the ciliary body, and the bulbar conjunctiva. Carrier-mediated transport through SLC transporters may occur in addition to passive diffusion. Moreover, nanoparticles can be loaded into DR-SCLs, offering various intelligent approaches based on modifications to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis/transcytosis or to control the loaded drug release within this delivery system.

drug delivery,A novel approach to achieve semi-sustained drug delivery to the eye through asymmetric loading of soft contact lenses,"Soft contact lenses are increasingly being explored as a vehicle for controlled delivery of ophthalmic drugs. However, traditional methods of drug-loading by soaking have limitations such as burst delivery and the release of drugs at the front side of the lens, leading to poor drug efficacy and systemic side effects. This study introduces a new methodology, termed asymmetric drug loading, whereby the ophthalmic drug 'Rebamipide' is attached to and released from the post-lens (=cornea-contacting) surface exclusively. The methodology involves using polymeric microparticles that carry a lipophilic crystalline ophthalmic drug at their surface. These drug-loaded microparticles first transfer the drug to the concave surface of the contact lens, and when worn, the drug is transferred again, now from the lens to the cornea. This is achieved through the diffusion of the drug from one hydrophobic microenvironment (the silicone moieties of the contact lens polymer network) to another hydrophobic microenvironment (the corneal epithelium) over a short pathway. The second drug transfer was observed and studied in experiments using an ex vivo porcine eye model. The results show that the drug amount that was absorbed by the cornea after applying the rebamipide-loaded contact lenses is approximately 3× (10.7 ± 3.1 μg) as much as the amount of rebamipide that gets transferred after the instillation of one eye drop (1% solution (p < 0.001).

Median age was 41 years (range, 12-83 years). Corneal transplantation was required or planned in 55 (34%). One hundred fifty-four (94%) of the confirmed case patients wore soft contact lenses. Forty-five case patients and 78 controls were included in the case-control study. Case patients were significantly more likely than controls to report using a specific contact lens solution, ReNu with MoistureLoc (69% vs 15%; odds ratio, 13.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.1-119.5). The prevalence of reported use of ReNu MultiPlus solution was similar between case patients and controls (18% vs 20%; odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-2.8). Fusarium was not recovered from the factory, warehouse, solution filtrate, or unopened solution bottles; production of implicated lots was not clustered in time. Among 39 isolates tested, at least 10 different Fusarium species were identified, comprising 19 unique multilocus genotypes.The findings from this investigation indicate that this outbreak of Fusarium keratitis was associated with use of ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution. Contact lens users should not use ReNu with MoistureLoc.",2006-08-22,Douglas C. Chang,Gavin B. Grant,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Manufacturing of Soft Contact Lenses Using Reusable and Reliable Cyclic Olefin Copolymer Moulds,"We present experimental evidence of reusable, reliable cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) moulds in soft contact lens manufacturing. The moulds showed high performance surface roughness characteristics despite >20 kW exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light from repeated use. Ultra-precision manufacturing techniques were used to fabricate transparent COC mould inserts and to produce soft contact lenses from liquid monomer compositions. Both polymer and silicone hydrogels were fabricated with more than 60 individual uses of the moulds. White light interferometry measured the surface roughness (Sa) of the COC moulds to be almost unchanged before and after repeated use (Sa 16.3 nm before vs. 16.6 nm after). The surface roughness of the prototyped lenses and that of commercially available soft contact lenses were then compared by white light interferometry. The surface roughness of the lenses was also nearly unchanged, despite undergoing more than 60 uses of the COC moulds (lens Sa 24.4 nm before vs. after Sa 26.5 nm). By comparison the roughness of the commercial lenses ranged from 9.3−28.5 nm, including conventional and silicone lenses, indicating that the reusable COC moulds produced competitive surface properties. In summary, COC moulds have potential as reusable and reliable mould inserts in the manufacturing of soft contact lenses, yet maintain high quality optical surfaces even after sustained exposure to UV light.",2022-11-02,Christopher S. A. Musgrave,Lorcan O’Toole,University College Dublin,IE,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It discusses the use of cyclic olefin copolymer moulds in the manufacturing of soft contact lenses, which aligns with the company's research objective on emerging technologies and manufacturing processes for optical materials. The demonstrated reliability and surface quality of the moulds after extensive use is particularly pertinent to the development of high-quality lens manufacturing."
manufacturing,Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels Reinforced with Nanocellulose for Ophthalmic Applications: General Characteristics and Optical Properties,"Globally, uncorrected refractive errors are one of the main causes of visual impairment, and contact lenses form an important part of modern day eye care and culture. Several hydrogels with varying physicochemical properties are in use to manufacture soft contact lenses. Hydrogels are generally too soft and reinforcement with appropriate materials is desirable to achieve high water content without compromising mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a highly transparent macroporous hydrogel with water content >90%, by combining poly(vinyl alcohol) with nanocellulose. Furthermore, the results show that the composite hydrogel has refractive index close to that of water and very good UV-blocking properties.",2016-12-01,Gopi Krishna Tummala,Ramiro Rojas,Uppsala University,SE,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It discusses a newly developed hydrogel for soft contact lenses, specifically focusing on its properties such as high water content, transparency, and UV-blocking capabilities, which aligns well with the company's research objectives in manufacturing processes and optical materials for vision care."
manufacturing,Impact of Manufacturing Technology and Material Composition on the Clinical Performance of Hydrogel Lenses,"Purpose. To establish the clinical impact of three different methods of manufacture used to produce soft contact lenses. Methods. Clinical performance of five lens types was investigated by undertaking a prospective, double-masked, randomized, crossover study. Three of the lenses were made from poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) by three different manufacturing processes (lathing, spin casting, and cast molding), and the remaining two lenses were cast molded from different materials—hydroxyethyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid and hydroxyethyl methacrylate/glycerol methacrylate (HEMA/GMA). All lenses were specially fabricated for this work at the same manufacturing plant. Thirty-four soft contact lens wearers wore each lens for 1 month on a daily-wear basis. Several clinical variables, such as ocular response, visual acuity, lens fitting, prelens tear film, lens surface dehydration, subjective response, and protein deposition, were measured. Results. In general, the spun-cast pHEMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other pHEMA lenses. This lens induced significantly more limbal and conjunctival hyperemia than the cast-molded lens and provided poorer low contrast visual acuity (LCVA) than the other two lenses. It dehydrated more and had the least on-eye movement. However, the spun-cast lens deposited the least protein of the pHEMA lenses. In general, the HEMA/GMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other cast-molded lenses. LCVA was worse with this lens, and subjective responses showed that this lens was thought to give the worst visual performance of the cast-molded lenses. It was also thought to be the most difficult lens to handle. Significantly more breakages occurred with this lens than any other. Conclusions. Overall, this work has shown that manufacturing method and material composition have a fundamental effect on many clinical properties of a lens. Therefore, method of manufacture is also an important consideration in the overall production of a soft lens.",2004-06-01,Carole Maldonado‐Codina,Nathan Efron,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It directly investigates the impact of different manufacturing methods and material compositions on the clinical performance of soft contact lenses, aligning well with the company's interest in emerging technologies and manufacturing processes related to lens technologies."
manufacturing,Development of Contact Lenses and Their Worldwide Use,"The concept of applying a lens to the cornea as a refractive appliance was first proposed in the early 19th century. By 1888, glass scleral lenses for the correction of optical defects and irregularities were manufactured and used. New materials, especially soft hydrogel lenses and rigid gas-permeable lenses, became available in the 20th century and allowed comfortable contact lenses to be made in any design needed. By the 21st century, the increasing use of silicone hydrogel lenses to address the oxygen need of the cornea has led to increased worldwide use. Of the 125 million global contact lens wearers, most are female and relatively young. Soft lenses are by far the dominant modality used, with silicone hydrogel lenses taking an increasing share of new fittings, particularly for overnight wear. Microbial keratitis, although relatively uncommon, remains the most serious potential complication for these lens wearers. Ongoing basic research, more powerful antimicrobial agents, and the development of safer lens materials are helping to alleviate this problem.",2007-11-01,James E. Key,,Bausch & Lomb (France),FR,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it discusses the evolution and current trends in contact lens technology, particularly focusing on soft lenses, which aligns with the company's main research topic.

manufacturing,Overnight Corneal Reshaping versus Soft Disposable Contact Lenses: Vision-Related Quality-of-Life Differences From a Randomized Clinical Trial,"Purpose. The purpose of this article is to evaluate patients' visual acuity, symptoms, and perceptions of vision-related quality of life in a randomized crossover clinical trial of overnight corneal reshaping (OCR) and daily wear soft lenses (SCL). Methods. Qualified subjects were randomly assigned to wear one mode of contact lens for 8 weeks and then, after a washout period, they wore the alternate mode for 8 weeks. On concluding each contact lens wear mode, subjects completed the NEI-RQL42 questionnaire. During the SCL mode, subjects wore lenses during their waking hours. During the OCR mode, subjects wore lenses only while sleeping. Soft lenses were Biomedics 55 2-week disposable lenses. OCR lenses were CRT lenses by Paragon. (Three subjects were fit with custom-designed OCR lenses in Boston XO material, manufactured by Art Optical.) LogMAR acuity was measured and slit lamp evaluation was performed at specified intervals during follow up. After completing both phases of the study, patients chose which mode they preferred. Results. Of 81 enrolled patients, 65 completed both phases and 16 dropped out during the study. Significant differences (p < 0.01) favoring SCL wear included better visual acuity and less trouble with glare. Significant differences (p < 0.01) favoring OCR wear included less activity limitations, less trouble with symptoms, and less dependence on refractive correction. Of 65 completing both phases, 44 preferred the OCR lenses and 21 preferred the soft lenses. Subjects who preferred the OCR lenses were less myopic and had steeper K readings at baseline, and showed less difference between visual acuity during OCR wear and visual acuity with SCL. Conclusion. In subjects with mild myopia who experienced both SCL and OCR, better visual acuity and less glare resulted from SCL wear, whereas activity limitations, symptoms, and dependence on refractive correction were less troublesome with OCR wear. When the study was completed, 67.7% chose OCR lenses worn only while sleeping, whereas 32.3% preferred 2-week disposable soft lenses worn during the day as their preferred correction.",2005-10-01,Michael Lipson,Alan Sugar,University of Michigan,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it compares the vision-related quality of life outcomes between overnight corneal reshaping and soft contact lenses, directly aligning with the company's focus on soft contact lenses and lens technologies.

manufacturing,Initial in Vivo Tear Protein Deposition on Individual Hydrogel Contact Lenses,"We investigated and compared the initial composition, morphology, and time course of deposits on individual soft contact lenses of different water contents and surface charges in order to evaluate the potential for antigenic reactions and to predict the optimal frequency of lens replacement. Newly manufactured lenses were worn for graduated periods of time from 1 min to 8 h by subjects who were first adapted to daily wear soft lenses. The morphology and composition of the deposits were analyzed by histological staining, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) with silver nitrate staining, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The protein bands of the acrylamide gels were divided according to their molecular weights into six groups which have been defined in the literature from tear analyses by electrophoretic techniques and include lysozyme, proteins migrating faster than albumin (PMFA), protein G, albumin, lactoferrin, and other proteins heavier than albumin such as Ig-G and secretory Ig-A. Specific proteins (lysozyme, PMFA, and protein G) were detected on individual lenses after as little as 1 min of wear. There was an increasing amount of protein deposited as the wearing time increased. Differences in the rates and amounts of deposition were more dependent on lens water content and ionic characteristics than on intersubject differences. Such early significant protein deposition may occur in wearers of disposable lenses as well as in those subject to complications due to accumulation of protein.",1990-07-01,Charles Leahy,Robert B. Mandell,New England College of Optometry,US,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

manufacturing,Surface chemical structure for soft contact lenses as a function of polymer processing,"The surface chemistry and topography of cast-molded Etafilcon-A and doubled-sided lathed Etafilcon-A soft contact lenses were determined to be significantly different. The variations in surface chemical and morphologic structure between the two lenses were the result of contact lens manufacturing methods. The surface of the cast-molded Etafilcon-A had a consistently less rough surface compared to the doubled sided lathed Etafilcon-A as determined by atomic force microscopy. The surface of the doubled sided lathed Etafilcon-A contained primarily silicone and wax contamination in addition to minute amounts of HEMA. The cast-molded Etafilcon-A had an elemental and chemical content which was consistent with the polymer stoichiometry. Contact angle wettability profiles revealed inherent wettability differences between the two lenses types. The cast-molded Etafilcon-A had an inherently greater water wettability, polarity, and critical surface tension. This means that these two lenses cannot be compared as similar or identical lens materials in terms of surface composition. The manufacturing method used to produce a soft contact lens directly determines the surface elemental and chemical structure as well as the morphology of the finished lens material. These results suggest possible differences in the clinical comfort, spoilage, and lubricity felt during patient wear. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",1996-09-01,George L. Grobe,Paul L. Valint,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It focuses on the surface chemical structure and manufacturing processes of soft contact lenses, specifically Etafilcon-A, which aligns with the company's interest in manufacturing, optical materials, and lens technologies.

manufacturing,Trends in Australian contact lens prescribing during the first decade of the 21st Century (2000–2009),"The aim was to document contact lens prescribing trends in Australia between 2000 and 2009.A survey of contact lens prescribing trends was conducted each year between 2000 and 2009. Australian optometrists were asked to provide information relating to 10 consecutive contact lens fittings between January and March each year.Over the 10-year survey period, 1,462 practitioners returned survey forms representing a total of 13,721 contact lens fittings. The mean age (+/- SD) of lens wearers was 33.2 +/- 13.6 years and 65 per cent were female. Between 2006 and 2009, rigid lens new fittings decreased from 18 to one per cent. Low water content lenses reduced from 11.5 to 3.2 per cent of soft lens fittings between 2000 and 2008. Between 2005 and 2009, toric lenses and multifocal lenses represented 26 and eight per cent, respectively, of all soft lenses fitted. Daily disposable, one- to two-week replacement and monthly replacement lenses accounted for 11.6, 30.0 and 46.5 per cent of all soft lens fittings over the survey period, respectively. The proportion of new soft fittings and refittings prescribed as extended wear has generally declined throughout the past decade. Multi-purpose lens care solutions dominate the market. Rigid lenses and monthly replacement soft lenses are predominantly worn on a full-time basis, whereas daily disposable soft lenses are mainly worn part-time.This survey indicates that technological advances, such as the development of new lens materials, manufacturing methods and lens designs, and the availability of various lens replacement options, have had a significant impact on the contact lens market during the first decade of the 21st Century.",2010-06-23,Nathan Efron,Philip B. Morgan,Queensland University of Technology,AU,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant as it provides a comprehensive overview of contact lens prescribing trends in Australia, particularly in the context of soft contact lenses. It highlights changes in lens types and materials, which aligns with the company's focus on emerging technologies and manufacturing processes in the lens market."
manufacturing,Possible environmental sources of Acanthamoeba spp in contact lens wearers.,"The water supply and dust samples from the home environment (bathrooms and kitchens) of 50 wearers of contact lenses (CLs) were cultured for the presence of free-living amoebae. CL cases, solutions, and water taps were cultured for bacteria, which amoebae require for growth. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from water drawn from six bathroom cold water taps (tank supplied), five in the presence of limescale, and from one kitchen cold water tap (mains supplied). There was an association between the presence of limescale in water and direct culture for free-living amoebae, suggesting that scale provides a favourable microenvironment for amoebae. Acanthamoebae were also found in dust from around one washbasin. Nineteen of 50 CL cases, 12/122 CL care rinsing solutions, and 59/100 cold water taps yielded Gram negative bacteria which could be ingested by amoebae. It is concluded from this study that CLs should not be washed in first-drawn tank-fed cold water, especially if limescale is present, and that soft CLs should be rinsed in manufactured single-use, sterile solutions. Rigid CL and CL cases should only be washed with boiled tap water (preferably hot), or single-use sterile solutions, and stored dry to prevent multiplication of amoebae and Gram negative bacteria.",1992-07-01,David Seal,Fiona Stapleton,Institute of Ophthalmology,MX,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It addresses the environmental risks associated with soft contact lenses, specifically the presence of Acanthamoeba spp and associated bacteria, which is critical for developing safe manufacturing processes and care guidelines within the context of soft contact lenses."
manufacturing,Influence of Soft Contact Lens Design on Clinical Performance,"A double-masked, randomized study in four parts was conducted to evaluate the effect of varying certain soft contact lens design parameters on clinical performance. The effects of varying back optic zone radius (BOZR) (8.20 to 9.00 mm), back surface design (monocurve, bicurve, aspheric), edge thickness (0.12 to 0.24 mm), and back vertex power (+1.00 to −6.00 D) were investigated using test lenses manufactured in a high water content material. In each part of the study, between 20 and 35 volunteer subjects wore a range of lenses which were assessed after >30 min settling periods. Postblink movement and lens ""tightness"" as assessed by the push-up test were unaffected by the variation in BOZR. Lenses of flatter BOZR centered lower and more temporally than steeper lenses. Lenses of similar back surface sagittal depth, but differing in terms of back surface design, did not center the same; the monocurve lenses decentered more than bicurve or aspheric lenses. Edge thickness had no significant effect on comfort or lens fit. Plus power lenses resulted in more postblink movement than minus lenses of similar power. The results are discussed in relation to the design and fitting of soft contact lenses.",1993-05-01,Graeme P. Young,Brien A. Holden,UNSW Sydney,AU,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It investigates key design parameters of soft contact lenses that can affect clinical performance, aligning closely with the company's focus on lens technologies and manufacturing processes in the realm of soft contact lenses."
manufacturing,Impact of manufacturing technology and material composition on the mechanical properties of hydrogel contact lenses,"Abstract Hydrogel materials are not only different as a result of different co‐monomer compositions but also as a result of the manufacturing method used to produce them. Hydrogel contact lenses fabricated by different methods are subjected to markedly different processing steps, which are likely to affect the resultant material network structure of a lens. The mechanical performance of five soft contact lens types was investigated using one conventional technique (tensile test) and three novel techniques (probe, tear and ball milling tests). The five lens groups consisted of three polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA) lenses which were each manufactured by a different technique: lathing, spin‐casting and cast‐moulding, a HEMA/methacrylic acid (HEMA/MAA) cast‐moulded lens and a HEMA/glycerol methacrylate (HEMA/GMA) cast‐moulded lens. Overall, the results show that the best mechanical performance is obtained for the pHEMA lenses, with some differences occurring between the lenses. The HEMA/GMA lens showed the worst performance.",2004-10-19,Carole Maldonado‐Codina,Nathan Efron,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It investigates the manufacturing technology and material composition of hydrogel contact lenses, which aligns with the company's interest in emerging manufacturing technologies and smart lenses.

manufacturing,A Comparison of Wavefront Aberrations in Eyes Wearing Different Types of Soft Contact Lenses,"Purpose. The purpose of this study is to investigate the optical quality of eyes wearing different types of soft contact lenses (sCLs) using wavefront aberrometry. Method. A psychophysical aberrometer (WFA1000B; BriteEye, SuZhou, China) was used to measure wavefront aberrations for 56 eyes of 28 subjects under four conditions: 1) without contact lenses (non-CL), 2) with lathe-cut contact lenses (lathe-cut CL; Shuliang, Weicon Optics, Shanghai, China), 3) with cast-molded contact lenses (cast-molded CL; Vistavue, J&J Vision Care, U.S.), and 4) with spun-cast contact lenses (spun-cast CL; Lanfenzhiji, Justcome Optics, Beijing, China). The three types of sCLs were made from different materials and lens design. The root mean square (RMS) values of the wavefront aberrations and individual Zernike aberrations were calculated and compared among the CL-wearing conditions. Results. Astigmatism was not significantly changed by any of the three soft contact lenses when compared with the non-CL condition. However, a significant difference in the RMS values of higher-order aberrations was observed between the lens types (F = 8.29, p < 0.0001). Induced higher-order aberrations were found for both the cast-molded CL and the spun-cast CL conditions. There were significant differences in the aberrations in each of the higher orders between the CL conditions (F = 3.77, p = 0.011 for third order; F = 5.31, p = 0.002 for fourth order; F = 13.86, p < 0.0001 for fifth and higher orders). More higher-order Zernike aberrations such as coma and spherical aberration were induced by cast-molded CLs and/or the spun-cast CLs. Conclusion. Wavefront aberrations in the eyes with soft contact lenses vary from one individual lens type to another. Although the variation in wavefront aberrations could be attributed to the differences in the methods of manufacture, influences from other factors such as the lens material and lens design could not be excluded and deserve further investigation.",2006-10-01,Jiang Hong-jun,Dan Wang,Peking University,CN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It investigates the optical quality of different types of soft contact lenses and evaluates their wavefront aberrations, which directly aligns with the company's focus on soft contact lenses and emerging lens technologies.

manufacturing,Omafilcon A (Proclear) soft contact lenses in a dry eye population.,"We conducted a 3-month, randomized, comparative cross-over study to evaluate the clinical performance of lenses manufactured from omafilcon A on subjects with signs and symptoms of dry eye. The subjects' own daily wear soft lenses were used as controls.Seventy-six subjects with objective evidence of dry eye, as defined in the NEI/Industry Workshop Report 1995, were fit with either the omafilcon A lenses (Proclear) or new control lenses. Subjects wore the lenses for 6 weeks and then crossed over to bilateral wear of the other lenses for an additional 6 weeks. During each part of the study, we examined subjects at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 weeks. Signs and symptoms of dry eye were evaluated, and on-eye dehydration of the lens was assessed.When the subjects were wearing the omafilcon A lenses, there was a statistically significant improvement in a number of subjective parameters including comfort, dryness, frequency of eye irritation, and frequency of burning. We found significantly less on-eye dehydration of the lens and fluorescein corneal staining with the omafilcon A lenses.This study indicated that the daily wear of omafilcon A lenses provided better comfort, fewer symptoms, less on-eye dehydration, and less fluorescein corneal staining than other soft daily wear contact lenses in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye.",1999-01-01,Michael A. Lemp,Barbara Caffery,Biocompatibles (United Kingdom),GB,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It specifically evaluates the performance of omafilcon A soft contact lenses in a dry eye population, which aligns with the company's main topic of soft contact lenses and provides insights into comfort and dehydration metrics."
manufacturing,Quantification of Intramolecular Cyclization in Branched Copolymers by<sup>1</sup>H NMR Spectroscopy,"Statistical copolymerization of a monovinyl with a divinyl monomer leads to macroscopic gels, microgels, or soluble branched copolymers, depending on the precise reaction conditions. This approach is widely used for the manufacture of soft contact lenses and also to prepare various biomedical hydrogels for the separation and purification of proteins, DNA, etc. According to Flory–Stockmayer theory, gelation should occur in such copolymerizations if there is more than 0.50 fully reacted divinyl comonomer per primary chain. However, many experimental studies indicate significant deviations from this classical theory, which are generally believed to be due to wastage of the divinyl comonomer via intramolecular cyclization. Unfortunately, experimental verification of this side reaction has proven elusive for the past seven decades. In the present study, we use a disulfide-based cleavable bifunctional comonomer to undertake the first experimental quantification of the extent of intramolecular cyclization in nonlinear methacrylic copolymers using 1H NMR spectroscopy.",2012-03-13,Julien Rosselgong,Steven P.

manufacturing,PDMS and its Suitability for Analytical Microfluidic Devices,"Poly(dimethylsiloxane) also known as PDMS is used in a wide range of biomedical applications. These range from implants through catheters to soft contact lenses. Therefore, it is understandable that PDMS has been extensively tested for these purposes. In past years, the microfluidics has moved from predominantly silicon and glass structures towards polymers due to their ease of manufacturing and moderate cost. PDMS has gained a lot of attention in various analytical applications. However, the testing of its suitability for such applications has not been as thorough as in the biomedical applications, perhaps relying on the experiments from that field. Microfluidic PDMS structures are more and more popular in various analytical devices. Such devices consume less reagents and can work with lower sample volumes. On the other hand, the surface-to-sample-volume ratio becomes larger. That increases the influence of material properties on the actual measurement. Some of the challenges include adsorption, diffusion, surface roughness, permeability and elasticity of PDMS, which are discussed in this paper.",2006-08-01,Johana Kuncová-Kallio,Pasi Kallio,Tampere University,FI,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,A Biphasic Model for Micro-Indentation of a Hydrogel-Based Contact Lens,"The stiffness and hydraulic permeability of soft contact lenses may influence its clinical performance, e.g., on-eye movement, fitting, and wettability, and may be related to the occurrence of complications; e.g., lesions. It is therefore important to determine these properties in the design of comfortable contact lenses. Micro-indentation provides a nondestructive means of measuring mechanical properties of soft, hydrated contact lenses. However, certain geometrical and material considerations must be taken into account when analyzing output force-displacement (F-D) data. Rather than solely having a solid response, mechanical behavior of hydrogel contact lenses can be described as the coupled interaction between fluid transport through pores and solid matrix deformation. In addition, indentation of thin membranes ( approximately 100 microm) requires special consideration of boundary conditions at lens surfaces and at the indenter contact region. In this study, a biphasic finite element model was developed to simulate the micro-indentation of a hydrogel contact lens. The model accounts for a curved, thin hydrogel membrane supported on an impermeable mold. A time-varying boundary condition was implemented to model the contact interface between the impermeable spherical indenter and the lens. Parametric studies varying the indentation velocities and hydraulic permeability show F-D curves have a sensitive region outside of which the force response reaches asymptotic limits governed by either the solid matrix (slow indentation velocity, large permeability) or the fluid transport (high indentation velocity, low permeability). Using these results, biphasic properties (Young's modulus and hydraulic permeability) were estimated by fitting model results to F-D curves obtained at multiple indentation velocities (1.2 and 20 microm/s). Fitting to micro-indentation tests of Etafilcon A resulted in an estimated permeability range of 1.0 x 10(-15) to 5.0 x 10(-15) m(4)N s and Young's modulus range of 130 to 170 kPa.",2006-09-13,Xiaoming Chen,Alison C.

mold,Controlled release of prednisolone acetate from molecularly imprinted hydrogel contact lenses,"Abstract The aim of this work was to study the influence of methacrylic acid (MAA) as a comonomer and the application of a molecular imprinting technique on the loading and release properties of weakly crosslinked 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) hydrogels, with a view toward their use as reloadable soft contact lenses for the administration of prednisolone acetate (PA). The hydrogels were prepared with HEMA (95.90–98.30 mol %) as a backbone monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (140 m M ) as a crosslinker, and MAA (0, 50, 100, or 200 m M ) as a functional monomer. Different PA/MAA molar ratios (0, 1 : 8, 1 : 6, and 1 : 4) in the feed composition of the hydrogels were also applied to study the influence of the molecular imprinting technique on their binding properties. The hydrogels (0.4 mm thick) were synthesized by thermal polymerization at 60°C for 24 h in a polypropylene mold. The hydrogels were then characterized by the determination of their swelling and binding properties in water. Their loading and release properties were also studied in 0.9% NaCl and artificial lachrymal fluid. Increasing the MAA content of the hydrogel and applying the molecular imprinting technique led to an increase in the loading capacity of the hydrogel. The optimized imprinted hydrogel showed the highest affinity for PA and the greatest ability to control the release process, sustaining it for 48 h. The results obtained clearly indicate that the incorporation of MAA as a comonomer increased the PA loading capacity of hydrogel. Our data showed that the molecular imprinting technique also had a significant effect on the loading and release properties of the hydrogels. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

mold,A concept for bifocal contact‐ or intraocular lenses: liquid single crystal hydrogels (“LSCH”),"Abstract The synthesis of liquid single crystal hydrogels (“LSCH”) in suitable molds offers an innovative concept to realize bifocal contact‐ or intraocular‐lenses. LSCH combine the properties required for applications as bifocal ophthalmic lenses: the soft and water‐containing hydrogel enables oxygen permeation and exhibits high birefringence due to the liquid crystalline phase structure built up by rigid rod‐like amphiphiles. Via a photo‐initiated crosslinking reaction of aqueous solutions of monomeric lyotropic liquid crystalline amphiphiles in the macroscopically ordered liquid crystalline state, we obtain optically uniaxially ordered and transparent LSCH. The orientation process and the phase structure of the anisotropic hydrogel is analyzed by deuterium NMR‐spectroscopy.

mold,Comparison of contrast sensitivity in different soft contact lenses and spectacles.,"To compare the visual performance of soft contact lenses and spectacles.Twenty eyes of ten patients were examined. Each patient was fit with Acuvue, Cibasoft, and Biomedics contact lenses in random order. LogMar visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using the VectorVision CSV-1000 were measured.There was no significant difference in visual acuity between any contact lenses (P=.15). Contrast sensitivity at 12 cycles/degree was significantly lower for the Cibasoft lens compared to spectacles (P=.04). There was no significant difference between spectacles and contact lenses for remaining spatial frequencies (P=.07-.35).Visual acuity appears to be an insensitive method for evaluating soft contact lenses.

mold,Broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of a new multi-purpose disinfecting solution.,"There has been increasing awareness of the need for more powerful contact lens disinfectants, ideally having low toxicity and allergenicity to ocular tissue. Opti-Free Express with ALDOX Multi-Purpose Disinfecting Solution (MPDS) was recently marketed as a new multi-purpose disinfecting solution for soft contact lenses. MPDS contains two antimicrobial agents, polyquaternium-1 and myristamidopropyl dimethylamine, to broaden the range of antimicrobial activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of MPDS against microorganisms that have been reported as contact lens and lens case contaminants and causative agents of microbial keratitis.MPDS was challenged with high numbers of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, mold, and Acanthamoeba. Several lots of product were challenged with at least three separate inocula of each isolate. After exposure to the disinfecting solution, a sample was removed from the product and plated for survivors by suitable recovery methods. The plates were incubated and the number of survivors was enumerated.The results showed that MPDS was bactericidal, fungicidal and amoebicidal against an extensive variety of environmental contaminants of lens care accessories and ocular pathogens. MPDS was capable of killing a broad spectrum of microorganisms.

mold,Ideal tetrafunctional amphiphilic PEG/PDMS conetworks by a dual‐purpose extender/crosslinker. II. Characterization and properties of water‐swollen membranes,"Abstract Select characteristics and properties of a series of ideal tetrafunctional amphiphilic conetworks consisting of random poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments crosslinked by a novel dual‐purpose crosslinker/extender were determined. The overall composition of the conetworks was varied in the 16–40% PEG range, and membranes were prepared by polymerizing/crosslinking charges in molds. Membranes were characterized by equilibrium swelling (both in water and n ‐heptane) and by determining their oxygen permeabilities and select mechanical properties. Swelling in water increases, whereas in heptane it decreases with increasing PEG content. Significant swelling in both solvents indicates bicontinuous (bipercolating) PEG and PDMS phases. Bicontinuity is reached with ∼13% PEG in the conetworks. The oxygen permeabilities of optically clear water‐swollen membranes containing 24, 32, and 40 wt % PEG are ∼350, ∼245 and ∼185 barrers, respectively, i.e. , oxygen permeability decreases by increasing the hydrophilic constituent. These oxygen permeabilities are far superior to those of contemporary soft contact lenses. The tensile strengths and moduli of water‐swollen membranes decrease, while elongations increase, with increasing PEG content. Dry membranes exhibit first order transitions at −52 and ∼46 °C indicating phase‐separated crystalline PDMS and PEG domains, respectively. Both dry and water‐swollen membranes are optically clear, indicating the presence of PEG and PDMS domains with dimensions well below the wavelength of visible light. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The shell molds are used for casting bi-aspheric soft contact lens with HEMA material. Moldex3D R13.0 is used to simulate and analyze the shrinkage of the front contact lens curve on the front shell mold in Z-axis direction. First, the design of experiment (DOE) method is applied to obtain the optimal setting parameters (melt temperature, injection velocity, and packing pressure). Amount of the shrinkage error is used to compensate the original design curve to improve the shrinkage error in the next simulations. The simulation result after compensation shows that the shrinkage error is reduced as 80.8%. The adding value to compensate the original design curve should be optimized to minimize shrinkage error. Result of this study can effectively improve the shrinkage error before fabricating the shell molds of the soft aspheric contact lens.",2017-01-01,Chao‐Chang A.

mold,Microbial contamination of hydrophilic contact lenses. Part I: Quantitation of microbes on patient worn-and-handled lenses.,"We cultured Soflens (polymacon) contact lenses to determine the number of microorganisms present following normal patient wear and handling just prior to disinfection. Total protein deposited was determined for the companion lens from each patient. A random population of 109 adapted soft contact lens patients participated in the study. Some patients participated more than once, resulting in a total of 196 lenses being cultured and 195 lenses analyzed for total protein. The left lens was cultured immediately. The right lens was extracted at 70 degrees C in sodium hydroxide, and the total protein in the extract determined using a modified Lowry protein assay. The mean protein deposition per lens was 3.4 micrograms (median 2 micrograms per lens; range less than 1 to 78 micrograms/lens). Microorganisms were cultured from 95% of the lenses. The mean bacterial count (in colony forming units per lens) was 2,482 (median: 123; range less than 3 to 150,000). Fungal contamination was found on 11% of the lenses at very low levels (3-9 yeast/lens and 3-18 mold/lens). Statistical analysis found no significant relationship between bacterial bioburden and any of the study parameters, including total protein, lens age, or subjective evaluation of lens cleanliness.",1992-04-01,M F Mowrey-McKee,K Monnat,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,An Unusual Case of Fungal Keratitis,"Purpose. To report a case of fungal keratitis caused by Metarrhizium anisopliae, which to our knowledge is the first reported case in the United States. Method. Case report. Results. A 36-year-old female librarian who wore extended-wear soft contact lenses was seen by an ophthalmologist on September 11 for an irritated right eye, and a corneal ulcer was diagnosed. Symptoms increased by September 27, and the patient was referred to another ophthalmologist who cultured the ulcer and had scrapings examined, which were Gram-negative for microorganisms. The patient was referred to one of the authors (W.J.R.). Her exam on October 1 showed vision corrected to 20/25 OD, a 5-mm epithelial defect with a 2.5-mm anterior stromal grayish-type infiltrate, and a quiet anterior chamber; the eye did not appear to be inflamed. The patient was reexamined on October 4 and was noted to have worsening vision. Because the initial cultures remained negative, the patient underwent a corneal biopsy, Gram stain, and cultures on October 6. Scrapings at the time of the biopsy revealed septate hyphal elements, as did the biopsy specimen, and on October 7, the patient was started on a treatment of bacitracin ointment once a day and natamycin 5% every hour. The eye gradually quieted down. A mold growing from the biopsy culture, which had been sent to a reference laboratory in San Antonio, Texas, was identified as M. anisopliae var. anisopliae. The patient was subsequently fitted with a rigid gas permeable lens, which resulted in a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20, although glare remained a major problem. Conclusion. Although not previously reported in the United States, M. anisopliae can cause a keratomycosis, and one must consider this common insect pathogen in the differential diagnosis of fungal keratitis.",2001-10-01,Binoy R.

mold,Moldable Crystalline α-Chitin Hydrogel with Toughness and Transparency toward Ocular Applications,"A N-acetylated chitosan hydrogel was investigated for ocular applications. One of the drawbacks in the original hydrogel protocol, poor moldability, was circumvented by optimizing the addition of the acetylating agent, acetic acid anhydride (Ac2O), at −10 °C. This simple but significant optimization realized the preparation of N-acetylated chitosan hydrogels with a wider variety of parameters such as higher chitosan concentration and molecular weight, the use of a more benign solvent (ethanol replaced methanol), and the arbitral shapes ranging from microbeads and contact lenses to bulky blocks that could be gripped. The prepared N-acetylated chitosan hydrogels exhibited high transparency and integrity given the nanofibrous network made of highly crystalline α-chitin. Furthermore, the gel retained a regenerable character: an oven-dried gel was reswollen by emersion in an acid bath. These previously unnoticed advantages and the innate high biocompatibility of chitosan and chitin elevate N-acetylated chitosan hydrogel as a next-generation bio-derived soft material for ocular applications such as contact lenses, artificial corneas, and drug delivery vehicles.",2020-03-17,Noriyuki Isobe,Mikiko Tsudome,Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,Shrinkage Analysis on Convex Shellby Injection Molding,"Abstract Injection molding of a convex shell has induced divergent flow front directions and therefore the shrinkage of a convex shell is difficult to controll. In some optical applications, such as ophthalmic devices of soft contact lens, that can be cast molded with a set of two convex shells made by injection molding there is a demand in maintaining dimensional stability. This research investigates the optimization of injection molding parameters for the minimum shrinkage of a convex shell of polypropylene (PP). The MPI 5.0 software is used first to simulate the filling stage of the convex shell and find the feasible operational ranges of parameters. Experiments were performed by an electric injection machine. Short shot experiments have been tested to compare with results of mold flow simulation. Taguchi's method is then used to find the optimal parameters for the minimum shrinkage of convex shell. Four parameters or factors, including mold temperature, injection temperature, holding pressure, and cooling time are considered in this study. An ANOVA table has been obtained for checking the significance of parameters. Results of simulation and experiments have been compared and the holding or packing pressure is found as the most significant parameter for the minimum shrinkage of a convex shell. Cooling time and injection temperature have been found as the second and third most significant parameters in this study. The optimal parameters have been established and then verified by the optimal injection molding experiment and the minimum shrinkage of convex shell was obtained as 72 μm.",2008-02-25,C.-C. A.

According to research results, SUS 304 stainless steel sheet with a micro-hole array could be smoothly fabricated into an original micro-lens array mold upon gas-assisted micro-hot embossing. At the same time, a micro-lens array structure with a complementary external form could be precisely remolded and reproduced by PDMS. Complete molding of micro-lens could be effectively achieved by combining imprints of gas-assisted lithography developed in this study, and even UV-NIL. The effective imprinting area and reproducibility of transfer printing could be greatly improved when a micro-lens contacts perfectly with a substrate surface. Moreover, since PDMS soft molds have short remolding times, and are easily feathered during manufacturing, production costs could be effectively reduced through features such as, low surface free energy, resistant to adhering to the mold during imprinting, and collocation of gas-assisted nanopowder imprinting of micro-structural processes.",2010-07-07,Yong-Cheng Wong,Yung-Jin Weng,National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,TW,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,Effect of softperm lens wear on corneal thickness and topography: a comparison between keratoconic and normal corneae.,"Complications related to contact lens-induced anoxia in the keratoconic eye are well documented, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study compared topographical changes in corneal thickness and anterior corneal radius following SoftPerm (Ciba Vision, Atlanta, GA) (rigid-and-soft combination) lens wear in a group of keratoconic and normal individuals.Video keratoscopic (VKS) (EyeSys, Houston, TX) and ultrasonographic pachometry measurements were taken at nine ocular locations, at central, mid-peripheral, and peripheral corneal areas of keratoconic and normal subjects. Subjects were subsequently fitted with SoftPerm lenses and further measurements of corneal topography and thickness were noted after 1 day, 2 weeks, and 1 month of daily wear.Corneal thickness increased significantly in normal and keratoconic eyes following SoftPerm lens wear. Radius values obtained from the VKS measurements indicated that a significant and progressive degree of corneal flattening occurred for the keratoconic subjects at the 1-day, 2-week, and 1-month intervals, in contrast to the normal group, whose corneal radii remained unchanged.Corneal swelling occurs in both normal and keratoconic corneas following SoftPerm lens wear.

mold,Metasurface‐Embedded Contact Lenses for Holographic Light Projection,"Contact lenses have been instrumental in vision correction and are expected to be utilized in augmented reality (AR) displays through the integration of electronic and optical components. In optics, metasurfaces, an array of sub-wavelength nanostructures, have offered optical multifunctionality in an ultra-compact form factor, facilitating integration into various imaging, and display systems. However, transferring metasurfaces onto contact lenses remains challenging due to the non-biocompatible materials of extant imprinting methods and the structural instability caused by the swelling and shrinking of the wetted surface. Here, a biocompatible method is presented to transfer metasurfaces onto contact lenses using hyaluronic acid (HA) as a soft mold and to allow for holographic light projection. A high-efficiency metahologram is obtained with an all-metallic 3D meta-atom enhanced by the anisotropy of a rectangular structure, and a reflective background metal layer.

mold,Results From the German Fungal Keratitis Registry: Significant Differences Between Cases With and Without a History of Contact Lens Use,"Purpose: Fungal keratitis (FK) is a serious ophthalmic disease with a potentially devastating outcome that seems to be increasing in recent years. The use of contact lenses (CLs) was evaluated as a risk factor for FK to determine possible differences in course and outcome. Methods: Data from 173 cases reported in the German FK registry until August 2019 were evaluated regarding CL behavior, other ophthalmological and general risk factors, age, sex, identified pathogens, conservative and surgical therapy, visual acuity, and findings at admission and follow-up. Results: One hundred seventy-four eyes from 173 patients between 2000 and 2019 were included [64.4% women, median age 54 (39; 72) years]; 49.7% wore CL, of which 81.3% were soft CL, and 50.3% had no history of contact lens use (NCL). CL users were significantly more often women and otherwise healthy (CL: 80.2% vs. NCL: 48.9%; P &lt; 0.0001). The spectrum of pathogens among CL users showed a significantly higher proportion of infections with filamentous pathogens, in particular Fusarium sp. (total filament: CL 69.8% vs. NCL 27.3%; P = 0.0001; Fusarium sp.: CL 50.0% vs. NCL 14.8%; P &lt; 0.0001). Overall, 54.6% required keratoplasty and 8.6% enucleation. Conclusions: CLS are the most important risk factor for FK in Germany. With CLs, typically, the infection is caused by molds, and patients are comparably younger and otherwise healthy. Often, extensive surgery is needed. To evaluate changes in the pathogen and resistance spectrum and to further monitor possible CL-related risk factors, a consistent collection of data remains paramount.",2021-06-15,Mathias Roth,Christoph Holtmann,Düsseldorf University Hospital,DE,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

mold,Fungal Keratitis Associated With Airborne Organic Debris and Soft Contacts Lenses: Case Reports and Review of the Literature,"Objectives: To report two cases of fungal keratitis in soft contact lens wearers who were exposed to environmental mold. Methods: Case reports, with review of the relevant literature. Results: Two otherwise healthy middle-aged women who were soft contact lens wearers developed fungal keratitis about 1 week after heavy exposure to environmental mold. Culture results showed Aspergillus from one patient and the unusual combination of Trichoderma and Penicillium from the other. Both were treated with topical natamycin, topical fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis, and periodic ulcer debridement. After many weeks of treatment, both ulcers healed with subsequent scarring. Because the ulcers were located in the peripheral cornea in both cases, excellent final visual acuities were achieved. Fungal keratitis cases like these are rarely seen at our referral clinic, which is located in the temperate climate of northeastern Indiana.

drug,Advances in chemistry and composition of soft materials for drug releasing contact lenses,"Ocular drug delivery has always been a challenging feat to achieve in the field of medical sciences. One of the existing methods of non-invasive ocular drug delivery is the use of eye drops. However, drugs administered through these formulations have low bioavailability in the ocular system. This limitation can been overcome by using contact lenses as drug delivery vehicles. According to USA FDA definitions they can be categorized into two main categories-hard and soft contact lenses. Based on the material properties, hard contact lenses are mostly produced from polymers of acrylate monomers such as MMA (methyl methacrylate). These have the least water retention capacity, thereby, having minimal ability to diffuse oxygen into the corneal layer and are not ideal for long term use. Soft material contact lenses are flexible and are mainly hydrogel based. They have higher water retention capacities as compared to rigid contact lenses, which gives them the ability to transmit oxygen to the corneal layer. These hydrogel based soft materials are mainly produced from polymers of acrylate monomers such as HEMA (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and found to be better for drug delivery contact lenses. These polymer-based soft materials have been efficiently modified in terms of their chemistry to achieve diverse physicochemical properties to produce efficient ocular drug delivery systems. However, complications such as drug leaching during storage and distribution, sterilisation, preservation of integrity of the lens and the possibility of surface roughness due to the incorporated drug molecules still need to be optimised. This review highlights the chemistries of various polymeric molecules through which physicochemical properties can be modified to achieve optimum drug loading and sustained release of the drug for application in the ocular system.",2020-01-01,Subir Chatterjee,Prashant Upadhyay,Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,IN,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Development and Efficacy of a Drug-Releasing Soft Contact Lens,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the uptake and the release of antibiotics from a newly synthesized drug delivery hydrogel soft contact lens (SCL) using an ion ligand mechanism.The antibiotics used were Gatifloxacin (GFLX) and Moxifloxacin (MFLX). The uptake amount and the sustained-release kinetics of antibiotics were investigated in vitro, and were also compared with newly synthesized SCLs, etafilcon A and polymacon. The antibiotic concentrations in the cornea, aqueous humor, and crystalline lens, and the effect against bacterial proliferation were investigated in vivo using rabbit subjects. Additionally the drug release efficacy of the new SCL was compared with that of eye drop administrations.In vitro, antibiotic uptake was increased with the weight percent (wt%) of the anionic group, and the released amount of antibiotics was highest during the initial 1 hour period, which then decreased over the next 72 hours. The released antibiotics volume of the new SCLs was significantly higher throughout 72 hours than that of the other two materials, etafilcon A and polymacon (P < 0.01). Whereas in vivo, the concentrations found in the cornea and aqueous humor were higher than those for the eye drop groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Antibiotic release at those sites decreased over 72 hours. No bacterial populations were detectable in the group treated with the new SCL presoaked in antibiotics throughout the experimental periods.The new SCLs released the antibiotics over several days, and showed improved penetration into the eye, along with prevention of bacterial proliferation.",2013-03-05,Koji Kakisu,Toru Matsunaga,Toho University,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,In vitro release of two anti-muscarinic drugs from soft contact lenses,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the release of the anti-myopia drugs atropine sulfate and pirenzepine dihydrochloride from commercially available soft contact lenses. Standard ultraviolet (UV) absorbance-concentration curves were generated for atropine and pirenzepine. Ten commercially available contact lenses, including four multifocal lenses, were loaded by soaking in atropine or pirenzepine solutions at two different concentrations (10 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL). The release of the drugs into phosphate-buffered saline was determined over the course of 24 hours at 34°C using UV absorbance. Materials with surface charge released the greatest amount of atropine when loaded with either concentration when compared to the other lens types (p<0.05), releasing upward of 1.026±0.035 mg/lens and 0.979±0.024 mg/lens from etafilcon A and ocufilcon A, respectively. There were no significant differences in the amount of atropine or pirenzepine released from the multifocal and non-multifocal lenses made from the same lens materials. Narafilcon A material demonstrated prolonged release of up to 8 hours when loaded with pirenzepine, although the overall dose delivered from the lens into the solution was among the lowest of the materials investigated. The rest of the lenses reached a plateau within 2 hours of release, suggesting that they were unable to sustain drug release into the solution for long periods of time. Given that no single method of myopia control has yet shown itself to be completely effective in preventing myopia progression, a combination of optical and pharmaceutical devices comprising a drug delivering contact lens presents a novel solution that warrants further investigation.",2017-09-01,Alex Hui,Magdalena Bajgrowicz,,,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,The Interaction and Compatibility Between a Soft Contact Lens and an Ophthalmic Drug,"To investigate the interaction and compatibility between a soft contact lens (SCL) and an ophthalmic drug.Samples were prepared with the nonionic SCL (groups I and II), the anionic SCL (group IV), and the zwitter ionic SCL (group IV). Chlorpheniramine maleate and sodium cromoglycate were used to measure the drug uptake into the SCL.The results showed the largest drug uptake into the anionic SCL accompanied with dimensional changes and lower drug uptakes into the nonionic and the zwitter ionic SCL with dimensional stability. The cell permeability of the substances when instilled in the eye over the SCL was also measured. The zwitter ionic SCL allowed cell permeability comparable to that by oral administration.These results indicated the possibility for the zwitter ionic SCL as a lens to be worn concomitantly with ophthalmic drug instillation.",2006-07-01,Masumi Kanemoto,Takao Sato,Juntendo University,JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant.

drug,Drug release from liposome coated hydrogels for soft contact lenses: the blinking and temperature effect,"In this article, liposome-based coatings aiming to control drug release from therapeutic soft contact lenses (SCLs) materials are analyzed. A PHEMA based hydrogel material loaded with levofloxacin is used as model system for this research. The coatings are formed by polyelectrolyte layers containing liposomes of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and DMPC + cholesterol (DMPC + CHOL). The effect of friction and temperature on the drug release is investigated. The aim of the friction tests is to simulate the blinking of the eyelid in order to verify if the SCLs materials coated with liposomes are able to keep their properties, in particular the drug release ability. It was observed that under the study conditions, friction did not affect significantly the drug release from the liposome coated PHEMA material. In contrast, increasing the temperature of release leads to an increase of the drug diffusion rate through the hydrogel. This phenomenon is recorded both in the control and in the coated samples. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

drug,Adsorption of Actives in Ophthalmological Drugs for Over-The-Counter on Soft Contact Lens Surfaces,"The adsorption of various kinds of ionic/nonionic actives, added in ophthalmological drugs (artificial tear, contact lens wetting solution, eye-drops, and eyewash) for over-the-counter (marketable drugs with no need of any medical prescription) , on soft contact lens (SCL) surfaces has been studied as a function of hydrophobicity of the actives. The common logarithm of the 1-octanol/water partitioning coefficient (AC_log P) has been used in order to normalize the hydrophobicity of the actives employed in this study. No significant adsorption occurs for relatively hydrophilic actives, whereas the adsorption rate is gradually increased with an increase in the hydrophobicity of the actives. This suggests that the adsorption is predominantly governed by the hydrophobic interaction of the actives with the SCL surfaces, although an electrostatic interaction plays an additional role for the adsorption. The most effective adsorption occurs in the following active-lens combinations: cationic actives--the anionic and hydrated lens IV (methacrylic acid-based SCL); anionic actives---the nonionic and hydrated lens II (N-vinyl pyrrolidone-based SCL); and nonionic actives--the anionic and less-hydrated lens III (containing hydrophobic silicone monomers).",2009-01-01,Nobuhito Tabuchi,Tadashi Watanabe,Lion Corporation (Japan),JP,yes,"Yes, the paper is relevant. It investigates the adsorption of active compounds in ophthalmological drugs on soft contact lens surfaces, aligning well with the company's focus on soft contact lenses and emerging technologies in drug delivery systems."
