Corneal topographic data is used to design a better fitting soft contact lens by achieving a contact lens back surface which is uniquely matched to a particular corneal topography, or which is an averaged shape based on the particular corneal topography. In the case of a uniquely matched contact lens back surface, the unique back surface design also corrects for the primary and higher order optical aberrations of the cornea. Additionally, ocular wavefront analysis is used to determine the total optical aberration present in the eye. The total optical aberration, less any corneal optical aberration corrected utilizing the contact lens back surface, is corrected via the contact lens front surface design.

The method provides a soft contact lens that, when in place (""flexed"") on the wearer's eye, is designed and manufactured to provide a substantially ellipsoidal anterior surface. In the method, an eye model including a cornea, a crystalline lens and a retina is constructed. Then a shape for an anterior surface of the cornea is selected to be a conic section having an eccentricity in the range of about 0.14<e<0.63. Next, a preliminary soft contact lens is selected having a center thickness, a radius, a posterior contact lens surface and an anterior contact lens surface to provide a prescribed plus or minus correction power such that, when applied to the anterior surface of the cornea, the anterior contact lens surface defining a conic section having a shape factor in the range of 0<E<1 or -1<E<0. An analysis is performed using the preliminary soft contact lens and eye model tracing light ray paths through the contact lens/eye system. The shape factor of the anterior contact lens surface when applied to the anterior surface of the cornea is varied within the range of 0<E<1 or -1<E<0 to achieve an contact lens/eye system wherein a trace of light ray paths is optimized for sharpest focus by minimizing a retinal spot size of the rays. Thus, an optimized anterior contact lens surface for the soft contact lens when applied to the anterior surface of the cornea is defined. A thickness profile is calculated for the optimum contact lens using the differences in distance between the anterior surface of the cornea and the optimized anterior contact lens surface at various values of the contact lens radius from the center of the contact lens. Contact lenses having the calculated thickness profile can be made by conventional methods.

This device utilizes a flexible bulb member, in cooperative combination with an attached tubular-shaped member, for supplying negative (suction) or positive (exhaust) pressure on a contact lens holder portion that is attached to the open or other end of the tubular-shaped member and thereby connected to the flexible bulb member. During the operation of removing the contact lens from the eye, a negative pressure or suction is applied to the contact lens from the contact lens holder portion by squeezing the flexible bulb member. The flexible bulb member also supplies an exhaust pressure on the contact lens by means of inserting the contact lens onto the eye. The contact lens holder portion is removable for asepticizing. Additional features include angling the contact lens holder portion with its attached tubular-shaped member at a preferred angle to permit, through use of a mirror, good visual observation of the insertion and extraction operations.
